# Multi-Platform First-Party Channels

## Status and relationship to prior work

This plan starts from the implemented channel model recorded in
`plans/2026-06-13-project-owned-channel-sdks-and-tools.md`.

Implementation completed on 2026-06-13. All ten provider outcomes are
implemented, validated on Node and workerd, and committed. Publication remains
deferred as described below.

The current branch already provides:

- discovered `channels/<name>.ts` modules;
- fixed provider-owned route suffixes beneath `/channels/<name>`;
- verified ingress packages for GitHub, Slack, and Discord;
- constructor-owned handlers receiving an extensible object containing the
  authentic Hono context;
- provider-specific acknowledgement and response handling;
- project-owned outbound SDK clients and application-owned tools;
- named `flue add` recipes, examples, documentation, Node tests, and workerd
  tests for the existing three providers.

This plan expands that model across the external platform adapters represented
in the Chat SDK repository at the reference commit below. It does not port Chat
SDK implementations or attempt to make Flue channel packages into full
bidirectional platform abstractions.

Publication remains outside this plan and requires a separate explicit release
request.

## Objective

Implement and validate first-party Flue channel support for these ten external
platforms:

| Platform | Flue package | Work in this plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | `@flue/github` | Audit and intentionally expand verified HTTP ingress where needed |
| Slack | `@flue/slack` | Audit existing surfaces and research additional signed HTTP ingress such as slash commands |
| Discord | `@flue/discord` | Audit HTTP interaction parity and document long-lived Gateway boundaries |
| Microsoft Teams | `@flue/teams` | Add a first-party channel package |
| Google Chat | `@flue/google-chat` | Add a first-party channel package |
| Linear | `@flue/linear` | Add a first-party channel package |
| Telegram | `@flue/telegram` | Add a first-party channel package |
| WhatsApp Business Cloud | `@flue/whatsapp` | Add a first-party channel package |
| Twilio Messaging | `@flue/twilio` | Add a first-party messaging channel package |
| Facebook Messenger | `@flue/messenger` | Add a first-party channel package |

For every platform, the completed product should include:

- a first-party ingress package where the provider has a stable verified HTTP
  protocol suitable for Flue channels;
- typed verified events or interactions and explicit unknown variants where
  the protocol permits useful forwarding;
- canonical conversation or destination identity helpers where a durable
  destination can be represented safely;
- a named `flue add <provider>` recipe;
- one buildable example showing a project-owned provider client and at least
  one narrow application-owned tool when an outbound operation is useful;
- a provider setup guide and package API reference;
- synthetic offline protocol tests, Node tests, and workerd tests;
- a canonical Cloudflare-compatible ingress and outbound project path for every
  provider;
- packed-package and clean-consumer validation;
- a recorded primary-source research brief, implementation log, deviations,
  and final capability audit.

The result is channel equivalence at the Flue ownership boundary: verified
provider ingress, identity, responses, and project integration guidance.
Outbound API breadth remains owned by provider SDKs and application code.

## Reference repository and clean-room boundary

The educational reference is:

```txt
/Users/fschott/Code/chat
commit 9c936f87960a968c9fa6070cd3188f68c989a7ac
dated 2026-06-09
```

The reference may be used to:

- enumerate external providers;
- learn that a broad capability or protocol surface exists;
- identify operational questions and hazards requiring independent research;
- create a high-level capability checklist for the final audit;
- compare completed behavior at the end to discover omissions.

The reference must not be used to:

- copy, translate, or mechanically derive source code;
- copy package architecture, route layouts, public types, normalized event
  models, schemas, algorithms, constants, or error behavior;
- copy README examples as implementation source;
- copy fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, test data, expected
  values, or test assertions;
- port tests one-for-one or use reference tests to drive implementation;
- preserve a reference behavior merely because it exists there.

The mandatory clean-room process for each provider is:

1. Record only a short capability and risk brief from the reference.
2. Stop consulting that provider's implementation and tests during design and
   coding.
3. Research the current official provider documentation, protocol
   specification, official SDK documentation, and official SDK source where
   necessary.
4. Design an original Flue API that follows Flue's existing channel contract.
5. Hand-author synthetic fixtures from official schemas or prose, using
   clearly distinct fake ids, text, timestamps, ordering, and optional fields.
6. Complete implementation and tests without reopening reference source or
   fixtures.
7. Use the reference only for a final independent capability-gap audit.
8. Resolve discovered gaps from primary sources, never by copying the
   reference.

Every provider implementation log must name the official sources used and
affirm that no reference implementation or fixture was copied.

## Scope boundary

### Included

- Official external platform adapters listed in the objective.
- Multiple HTTP methods and multiple provider-owned route suffixes when the
  official protocol requires them.
- Verification handshakes, signed requests, bearer-token/JWT validation,
  timestamp checks, replay-relevant metadata, exact-body handling, provider
  identity constraints, and response semantics.
- Provider-specific batching and retry metadata.
- Optional inbound surfaces whose callbacks publish routes only when enabled.
- Official provider SDKs or established maintained clients in project recipes,
  selected only when they execute on both Node and Cloudflare.
- Narrow direct `fetch` clients in project code when no suitable SDK exists.

### Excluded

- Chat SDK state adapters, shared packages, community adapters, and vendor
  adapters outside the official platform list.
- Chat SDK's `adapter-web`. It is a browser/AI SDK transport rather than an
  external provider webhook protocol. Flue already owns direct agent HTTP and
  WebSocket surfaces; any new browser transport should be planned separately.
- Copying or compatibility-layering Chat SDK APIs.
- A universal outbound provider client, universal tool collection, or universal
  channel event schema.
- OAuth installation flows, credential stores, tenant registries, app
  marketplaces, or dynamic multi-installation routing unless a provider cannot
  support a useful fixed-installation channel without them.
- Long-lived provider transports such as Slack Socket Mode, Discord Gateway,
  and Telegram polling in the initial channel packages.
- Twilio Voice. The initial `@flue/twilio` package is scoped to Messaging;
  voice should receive a separate explicit product decision.
- Live provider credentials or remote provider calls in automated tests.

## Product invariants

Every provider workstream must preserve these decisions:

1. **Ingress ownership:** Flue packages own provider request verification,
   parsing, identity checks, normalization, handshakes, and provider response
   constraints.
2. **Outbound ownership:** Applications initialize and export provider SDK
   clients. Flue packages do not wrap broad provider APIs.
3. **Tool ownership:** Applications define only the model-facing tools they
   need and bind trusted destinations in application code.
4. **Routing:** Immediate `channels/<name>.ts` files are discovered beneath the
   same `flue()` mount as agents and workflows.
5. **Namespaces:** The filename fixes `/channels/<name>`. Provider packages
   declare one or more non-empty suffixes such as `/webhook`, `/events`,
   `/interactions`, or another provider-native surface.
6. **Optional surfaces:** An omitted optional callback does not publish its
   route. Recipes show unused surfaces as commented examples rather than empty
   active handlers.
7. **Handler input:** Each callback receives one extensible object such as
   `{ c, event }`, `{ c, interaction }`, or another provider-appropriate name.
   The Hono `Context` remains intact under `c`.
8. **Responses:** Application handlers return `undefined`, a JSON-compatible
   provider response, or an ordinary Hono/Fetch `Response`. `undefined`
   becomes an empty `200` only when that provider protocol permits it.
9. **No eager callbacks:** Constructors store application handlers without
   invoking them during module evaluation.
10. **Identity:** Conversation keys are canonical identifiers, not
    authorization capabilities.
11. **Unknown inputs:** Verified but unsupported provider variants should be
    represented explicitly when forwarding them is safe and useful. Protocol
    control messages may instead be handled internally.
12. **Required targets:** Every channel package and canonical project
    integration must support both Node and Cloudflare Workers. Support must be
    demonstrated with the actual package and selected outbound client path,
    not inferred from a dependency's marketing, types, successful import, or
    successful bundle.
13. **Errors:** New Flue runtime errors follow the repository's structured
    error policy. Provider package errors follow the established package
    pattern and expose machine-testable classes or fields rather than requiring
    message matching.
14. **Project validity:** Channels do not replace the existing requirement for
    at least one agent or workflow.

Provider APIs should be internally consistent without forcing false
cross-provider uniformity. Constructor options, event names, trusted identity
inputs, required responses, and route counts may differ.

## Cloudflare compatibility baseline

Cloudflare is a required platform, not an optional target claim.

Use these current platform facts as the starting point, then verify them again
against current documentation during implementation:

- Workers provides standards-based Fetch, Web Crypto, URL, and Web Streams
  APIs suitable for most webhook verification and REST clients.
- Workers Web Crypto supports the major signing and verification algorithms
  these providers are likely to require, including HMAC, RSA, ECDSA, and
  Ed25519.
- `nodejs_compat` can expose supported Node APIs, but it may also make
  non-functional stubs importable. A successful import or bundle is therefore
  not a compatibility test.
- Google documents both client-library and direct HTTP service-account OAuth
  flows. Because direct JWT construction is security-sensitive, prefer a
  maintained cross-runtime authentication implementation when Google's own
  clients do not execute in Workers.
- Microsoft Bot Connector authentication is standards-based bearer JWT,
  OpenID/JWKS, OAuth, and HTTPS REST. If Microsoft's current JavaScript SDK is
  Node-oriented, independently validate a Workers implementation built from
  those official protocol surfaces and a proven cross-runtime JOSE library.

Initial compatibility findings on 2026-06-13:

- the current `google-auth-library` package declares a Node engine and brings
  Node-oriented authentication and transport dependencies. This does not prove
  that every operation fails in Workers, but it is not evidence of support and
  must not be selected without a complete workerd spike;
- the current `@microsoft/agents-hosting` package declares Node 20 and depends
  on packages including `@azure/msal-node`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `jwks-rsa`.
  Treat it as Node-oriented unless a complete Workers execution test proves
  otherwise;
- Microsoft's Bot Connector documentation explicitly states that no special
  SDK is required for its standard HTTPS/JSON authentication protocol;
- maintained Web-interoperable JOSE implementations exist with explicit
  Cloudflare Workers support, making JWT signing, verification, and remote
  JWKS a credible standards-based building block;
- Google recommends client libraries because service-account JWT construction
  is security-sensitive. The workstream should therefore investigate a
  maintained cross-runtime Google authentication implementation before
  considering direct JWT/OAuth code.

## Shared implementation process

Each provider should be owned as an end-to-end workstream. The implementor is
responsible for research, design, implementation, documentation, testing, and
the final audit rather than receiving a prematurely fixed event model from this
plan.

### 1. Establish the primary-source research brief

Record:

- official protocol and security documentation;
- official event, activity, update, or payload schemas;
- official acknowledgement deadlines and retry behavior;
- official verification, signing, issuer, audience, and replay rules;
- handshakes or challenge-response behavior;
- content types and body encodings;
- batch cardinality and ordering guarantees;
- delivery, interaction, update, or activity ids;
- stable tenant, application, workspace, account, page, bot, or installation
  identity available on verified requests;
- provider capabilities that must never enter model context or durable
  dispatch input;
- official or established JavaScript SDK candidates for application-owned
  outbound behavior;
- current Node and Cloudflare compatibility evidence.

Treat official examples as protocol documentation, not copyable fixtures.

### 2. Write a threat and trust model

Before designing types, state:

- which bytes or parameters are authenticated;
- which headers and payload fields become trusted after verification;
- which identity claims require explicit configuration;
- how request age, replay, duplicate delivery, and provider retries are
  represented;
- what public URL or proxy information participates in verification;
- which short-lived response URLs, tokens, or capabilities must be redacted;
- whether key discovery, JWKS caching, or key rotation is required;
- how verification behaves when network access to a key source is unavailable.

Do not parse and dispatch before verification unless the official protocol
requires limited parsing to locate verification material and that exception is
documented.

### 3. Inventory provider HTTP surfaces

Propose the smallest useful set of route suffixes and methods.

For each surface define:

- whether it is required or optional;
- whether configuration without a callback still needs the route for a
  handshake;
- its body encoding and body limit;
- its callback input;
- its default response;
- whether a response body is mandatory;
- whether it shares verification and event normalization with another route.

Do not combine semantically distinct protocols merely to reduce route count.
Do not publish unused optional surfaces.

### 4. Propose the normalized event and identity model

Design from Flue use cases and official provider semantics:

- normalize the fields applications routinely need for dispatch and routing;
- retain a `raw: unknown` escape hatch only after verification;
- use discriminated unions for meaningful variants;
- provide an explicit unknown variant where appropriate;
- preserve provider delivery and retry identifiers;
- represent one provider delivery containing multiple events without silently
  dropping entries;
- define canonical conversation or destination identity only where it remains
  stable enough for agent-instance selection;
- keep outbound capabilities and credentials out of canonical identity.

Review the proposal before implementation when it introduces a consequential
public constraint, such as collapsing a batch, choosing one conversation
boundary among several plausible boundaries, or requiring one installation
model.

### 5. Decide constructor and response contracts

Provider constructors may accept:

- secrets, public keys, tokens, expected identity, or verification URLs;
- a provider SDK object when the official SDK is the best verifier;
- injected verification dependencies needed for deterministic tests;
- one callback per enabled protocol surface;
- provider-specific body limits and bounded deadlines.

Do not require a provider SDK merely for consistency. Prefer Web Crypto and
small package-owned protocol code when that is clearer and more portable.

Use normal Hono and Fetch responses. Add a provider-specific JSON response type
only where it improves static correctness without recreating a large provider
SDK. Validate JSON compatibility at runtime.

### 6. Spike runtime and SDK compatibility

Before building the full package:

- prove the verification strategy in Node and workerd;
- bundle the selected project-owned outbound SDK through Flue's Node and
  Cloudflare targets;
- exercise one representative outbound SDK method against an injected or fake
  Fetch transport in both Node and workerd without contacting the provider;
- identify required compatibility flags, Node built-ins, dynamic imports,
  socket assumptions, or unsupported transports;
- choose the first viable option in this order:
  1. the official SDK when it explicitly supports Workers or passes the
     complete workerd execution spike;
  2. a well-maintained community client with demonstrated Workers support;
  3. a narrow project-owned Fetch client over the provider's official REST API,
     using a proven cross-runtime authentication or signing library where
     needed;
- reject a Node-only client as the canonical recipe dependency, even if it can
  be made to type-check or bundle;
- treat `nodejs_compat` as an implementation aid, not evidence of support.
  Cloudflare documents that some Node modules are partial implementations or
  non-functional import stubs, so the representative runtime operation must
  execute successfully;
- prefer Fetch, Web Crypto, URL, Web Streams, and cross-runtime JOSE/OAuth
  building blocks over Node-specific transports and filesystem-based
  credential discovery.

Record target-specific recipe branches. Do not weaken ingress ownership because
an outbound SDK is inconvenient.

Cloudflare support is a hard phase gate. If the research ladder above produces
no defensible Workers path, stop that provider before public API finalization,
record the evidence and attempted options, and bring the blocker to the user.
Do not silently ship a Node-only provider, omit the Cloudflare example, or mark
the provider complete with a target caveat.

### 7. Implement the package

Follow the existing `packages/github`, `packages/slack`, and
`packages/discord` package shape where it expresses the shared Flue contract,
but allow provider-specific modules and internal organization.

At minimum:

- export one `create<Provider>Channel()` constructor;
- export public verified input, event, response, identity, and structured error
  types needed by consumers;
- expose structural routes consumed by discovered channel routing;
- verify before invoking application callbacks;
- normalize provider inputs once;
- enforce documented limits and deadlines;
- handle protocol control messages internally where appropriate;
- serialize default and application responses deterministically;
- avoid any dependency on `@flue/runtime` unless a true ingress requirement is
  discovered and recorded;
- depend directly on Hono for public context and handler types.

Do not extract shared cross-provider verification infrastructure until at least
two implementations demonstrate the same stable internal need. Similar-looking
Meta protocols may begin with local code; shared code is justified only when it
reduces real complexity without coupling public APIs.

### 8. Design original synthetic coverage

Build fixtures independently from official schemas and prose:

- use obviously synthetic provider ids, names, text, URLs, and timestamps;
- alter object ordering and optional fields from official examples;
- generate valid signatures, tokens, and keys locally;
- include invalid signatures, stale timestamps, wrong audiences, wrong
  application identities, malformed bodies, oversized bodies, and wrong
  content types as applicable;
- cover batches, retries, duplicates, and unknown variants when the protocol
  supports them;
- avoid broad module mocking;
- intercept outbound SDK Fetch calls at a narrow transport boundary;
- never copy reference fixtures, payloads, snapshots, or expected outputs.

Tests should assert observable package behavior through mounted Hono routes,
not private helper implementation.

### 9. Add Node and workerd validation

For every package:

- run focused Node tests through its public constructor and routes;
- run workerd tests for exact-body handling, cryptography, JWT/JWKS logic,
  form parsing, response serialization, and other claimed behavior;
- type-check and build emitted declarations;
- pack the package and compile a clean strict TypeScript consumer;
- confirm the package contains no outbound client or tool implementation;
- confirm no accidental Node-only dependency is hidden by the local workspace.

Every provider must pass its workerd gate before it is complete. If the
canonical official SDK fails, replace it with a proven cross-runtime client or
narrow Fetch implementation and test the real authentication, serialization,
and request-construction path against a fake transport. If no sound path exists,
defer the provider for user review rather than weakening the required platform
matrix.

### 10. Add the project integration

Create:

- `connectors/channel--<provider>.md`;
- `examples/<provider>-channel/`;
- `apps/docs/src/content/docs/guide/channels/<provider>.md`;
- `apps/docs/src/content/docs/api/<provider>-channel.md`;
- package README content generated or prepared through existing repository
  conventions;
- navigation, channel overview, CLI examples, and changelog updates.

The recipe and example should:

- export `channel` and a project-owned `client`;
- put an accurate `// Path: ...` comment above every handler;
- show grouped event handling where it improves the example;
- dispatch only normalized, non-sensitive input;
- define one narrow tool justified by the example;
- bind trusted destinations outside model arguments;
- distinguish ingress verification credentials from outbound credentials;
- follow existing Node or Cloudflare secret conventions;
- keep optional unused surfaces commented out;
- type-check and build without real credentials.

The guide should teach the recommended setup. The API reference should document
the package-visible ingress contract, not duplicate the provider's API
reference.

### 11. Perform provider artifact review

Before the reference-repository audit:

- inspect the package tarball and declarations;
- inspect generated recipe output through the actual `flue add` path;
- run a locally signed or authenticated request against the built example;
- exercise handshakes and mandatory response bodies;
- exercise the deferred channel-agent import cycle;
- search docs, examples, and exports for accidental outbound abstractions,
  unrestricted tools, secrets in model-visible input, and unsupported runtime
  claims.

### 12. Perform the final reference gap audit

Only after implementation and tests are complete:

1. Reopen the high-level Chat SDK adapter documentation at the pinned commit.
2. Compare broad supported capability categories with the completed Flue
   channel, recipe, and example.
3. Record missing capabilities and classify each as:
   - applicable verified HTTP ingress;
   - outbound project behavior already enabled by the recipe;
   - long-lived transport outside channel scope;
   - installation/state concern outside the fixed-installation package;
   - deliberately unsupported provider feature.
4. Validate applicable gaps against current official provider documentation.
5. Implement justified gaps from primary sources.
6. Record remaining differences explicitly.

Do not use reference implementation or test files during this audit.

## Initial provider research briefs

These briefs identify likely questions. They are not final route, type, or SDK
specifications.

### GitHub

Existing Flue support verifies webhook deliveries and normalizes a small set of
issue and pull-request events.

Research and audit:

- identify the intentional event set needed for agent-driven GitHub workflows;
- preserve a useful unknown verified delivery rather than attempting an
  exhaustive webhook registry without product value;
- verify installation, repository, organization, enterprise, and hook identity
  boundaries;
- preserve ping handling, exact-body signatures, delivery ids, replay behavior,
  and form-encoded payload support where still official;
- decide whether additional normalized events materially improve the canonical
  recipe and example.

Primary starting points:

- <https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries>
- <https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads>

### Slack

Existing Flue support covers the Events API and interactions for one configured
application and workspace.

Research and audit:

- signed slash-command requests as a likely additional optional HTTP surface;
- Events API envelopes, retries, URL verification, app/workspace identity, and
  enterprise or organization installation constraints;
- interaction variants and provider-required immediate responses;
- response URLs and interaction capabilities that must not enter durable or
  model-visible data;
- whether the fixed-workspace v1 constraint remains the right initial product
  boundary;
- Socket Mode and OAuth as explicit non-goals unless separate evidence changes
  the scope.

- <https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/>
- <https://docs.slack.dev/interactivity/implementing-slash-commands>

### Discord

Existing Flue support covers signed HTTP interactions and provider responses.

Research and audit:

- command, component, autocomplete, modal, and future interaction variants;
- PING/PONG, response deadlines, deferred responses, application identity, and
  sensitive interaction tokens;
- whether additional HTTP interaction types should be normalized;
- the boundary between HTTP interactions and Gateway-delivered message events;
- Cloudflare behavior of the selected project-owned REST client.

Primary starting points:

- <https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/overview>
- <https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding>

### Microsoft Teams

Teams bot ingress is based on Bot Framework activities rather than an ordinary
shared-secret webhook.

Research and audit:

- Bot Connector bearer-token validation, OpenID/JWKS discovery, issuer,
  audience, service URL, tenant, and app identity;
- message, conversation update, invoke, Adaptive Card action, and other
  activity variants useful to agents;
- response and acknowledgement behavior for ordinary and invoke activities;
- stable conversation, tenant, team, channel, chat, and reply-chain identity;
- the current Microsoft 365 Agents SDK direction versus older Bot Framework
  JavaScript packages;
- outbound SDK and Cloudflare compatibility;
- a standards-based Workers fallback using Fetch for OAuth and Bot Connector
  REST plus a proven cross-runtime JOSE implementation when Microsoft's SDKs
  remain Node-oriented.

- <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/>

### Google Chat

Google Chat supports direct interaction events and may also deliver Workspace
Events through Pub/Sub.

Research and audit:

- Google-signed bearer-token verification, issuer, audience, app URL, and
  project-number expectations for direct Chat requests;
- differences between HTTP endpoint authentication and Pub/Sub push
  authentication;
- direct messages, mentions, added-to-space events, card actions, dialogs, and
  synchronous response objects;
- whether direct interactions and Workspace Events belong in one package with
  separate optional surfaces;
- space, thread, user, and app identity;
- service-account, delegated-user, and outbound Chat API client options for
  Node and Cloudflare;
- an edge-compatible service-account JWT assertion, OAuth token exchange, and
  Chat REST path when Google's Node client libraries do not execute in
  workerd. Prefer a maintained cross-runtime auth library; implement the
  standards-based flow directly only when the security contract is small,
  auditable, and thoroughly tested.

- <https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/verify-requests-from-chat>
- <https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/auth>

### Linear

Linear exposes ordinary webhooks and agent-specific session events with
different application semantics.

Research and audit:

- official webhook signature verification and request-age requirements;
- comment, issue, project, and other resource events useful for dispatch;
- agent session event types, acknowledgement deadlines, stop signals, prompt
  context, and session identity;
- whether webhooks and agent sessions require separate optional route surfaces;
- workspace, organization, actor, issue, comment, and agent-session identity;
- the boundary between a fixed workspace integration and OAuth installation
  state;
- use of `@linear/sdk` for outbound project behavior and any official
  verification helpers for ingress.

Primary starting points:

- <https://linear.app/developers/sdk-webhooks>
- <https://linear.app/developers/agents>
- <https://linear.app/developers/agent-session-events>

### Telegram

Telegram's Bot API webhook uses an optional secret token header rather than a
body signature.

Research and audit:

- `setWebhook` secret-token validation and the security implications of an
  equality token;
- update ids, retries, duplicate delivery, allowed update types, and response
  expectations;
- messages, edited messages, callback queries, commands, reactions, and other
  update variants useful for agents;
- chats, message threads, users, and forum topics as conversation identity;
- whether one update can safely map to one callback invocation;
- direct Bot API Fetch versus a maintained SDK for outbound project code;
- prefer direct typed Fetch when a bot SDK introduces Node-only runtime
  assumptions;
- polling as an explicit non-goal.

Primary starting point:

- <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook>

### WhatsApp Business Cloud

WhatsApp Cloud API uses Meta webhook verification and signed batched POST
deliveries.

Research and audit:

- GET challenge verification with a configured verify token;
- POST `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification with the Meta app secret;
- account, app, business, phone-number, and recipient identity constraints;
- messages, statuses, reactions, media, locations, contacts, and interactive
  replies;
- multiple entries, changes, and messages in one delivery;
- response deadline and retry behavior;
- direct Graph API Fetch or an established client for outbound project code;
- treat Graph API Fetch as the baseline Cloudflare path rather than requiring a
  Node-oriented Meta SDK.

Primary starting points:

- <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started>
- <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks>

### Twilio Messaging

Twilio signs requests using the configured public URL and request parameters,
and inbound messaging commonly uses form-encoded bodies and TwiML responses.

Research and audit:

- exact public URL reconstruction behind proxies and whether configuration
  should require an explicit webhook URL;
- signature handling for form parameters and any JSON webhook variants;
- inbound SMS/MMS fields, messaging-service identity, opt-out behavior, and
  media metadata;
- status callbacks as a distinct optional surface;
- empty acknowledgement versus TwiML response semantics;
- account, subaccount, messaging service, sender, recipient, and conversation
  identity;
- Cloudflare viability of the official Twilio helper library versus a small
  package-owned verifier and project-owned Fetch client;
- use direct REST Fetch for outbound messaging when the official Twilio client
  is Node-only; do not sacrifice Cloudflare support to preserve SDK symmetry;
- voice as an explicit non-goal.

Primary starting points:

- <https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security#validating-requests>
- <https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/guides/webhook-request>

### Facebook Messenger

Messenger uses Meta webhook verification and signed batched Page events.

Research and audit:

- GET challenge verification and POST app-secret signature validation;
- Page, app, recipient, sender, thread, and message identity;
- messages, quick replies, postbacks, reactions, delivery receipts, reads, and
  opt-in or referral events useful to agents;
- multiple entries and messaging events in one delivery;
- app/page subscription and installation concerns that remain outside a fixed
  channel;
- direct Graph API Fetch or a maintained client for outbound project code;
- treat Graph API Fetch as the baseline Cloudflare path rather than requiring a
  Node-oriented Meta SDK.

Primary starting points:

- <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started>
- <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhooks>

## Cross-provider test contract

Every package should intentionally cover applicable behavior from this list.
Tests should be added only where the behavior is a durable public contract.

### Verification and parsing

- exact unconsumed request bytes or official parameter canonicalization;
- valid, missing, malformed, and changed signatures or tokens;
- locally generated JWTs with valid and invalid issuer, audience, expiry, key,
  and identity;
- key rotation and bounded JWKS caching where required;
- request age and replay-window rejection where specified;
- expected provider/application/tenant/workspace/account identity;
- content type, encoding, body limits, malformed payloads, and Unicode;
- GET verification handshakes and POST delivery verification;
- public URL configuration and proxy behavior where the signature depends on
  the URL.

### Event behavior

- one representative known event for every intentional normalized family;
- explicit unknown verified variants;
- grouped switch cases in consumer code;
- batches with zero, one, and multiple applicable entries;
- retry and delivery metadata;
- duplicate ids forwarded without falsely claiming package deduplication;
- stable conversation-key round trips and invalid-key rejection;
- sensitive capability redaction from normalized input.

### Responses

- empty `200` defaults only where valid;
- plain JSON serialization;
- Hono `Response` passthrough and status control;
- provider-specific required response bodies;
- handshakes, challenge responses, PING/PONG, TwiML, invoke results, or card
  responses as applicable;
- thrown handlers and invalid return values;
- bounded handler deadlines where the provider imposes one.

### Routing and composition

- fixed filename-derived namespace and provider-owned suffix;
- every route has a non-empty suffix;
- multiple methods on one suffix where required;
- multiple optional surfaces and omitted-route behavior;
- wrong method and unknown suffix behavior through Flue runtime routing;
- root and prefixed `flue()` mounts;
- no authored `app.ts` requirement;
- channel-agent ESM cycles evaluated only through deferred callbacks.

### Target and artifact behavior

- Node build, types, and tests;
- workerd cryptography, parsing, route execution, and responses;
- actual outbound client import and one fake-transport operation in both Node
  and workerd;
- no acceptance based only on a successful Cloudflare bundle;
- explicit exercise of required authentication or request-signing logic in
  workerd;
- documented compatibility date and flags used by the test;
- clean packed-package TypeScript consumer;
- generated recipe registry behavior;
- example Node and Cloudflare builds for every provider;
- no provider network access in tests.

## Shared repository work

In addition to per-provider packages:

1. Expand the channel overview table and navigation for all supported
   providers.
2. Add named connector recipes and regenerate the connector registry.
3. Add focused `flue add` tests for every new recipe and alias.
4. Choose one canonical slug per provider. Use `google-chat` as the initial
   public proposal; record and review any naming deviation before package
   publication.
5. Add examples using the repository's existing `<provider>-channel` naming.
6. Update Knip entry patterns and workspace validation only where new
   discovered example modules require it.
7. Update release preparation so every public package's prepared docs and
   tarball are generated from canonical sources.
8. Keep the generic channel recipe provider-neutral and update it only when a
   cross-provider lesson improves unsupported-provider implementation.
9. Search for stale claims that only GitHub, Slack, and Discord are supported.
10. Keep packages independently releasable and avoid a shared runtime package
    unless repeated implementation evidence justifies one.

## Parallel ownership and commits

Provider research and implementation may proceed independently after the shared
contract is confirmed. Each workstream should own disjoint package, example,
recipe, guide, and API-reference files.

Commit work at coherent, reviewable points. A completed provider will often be
a natural commit boundary, but the implementor may split or combine work when
shared research, infrastructure, documentation, or validation makes another
history clearer. Before committing, inspect the worktree and stage only the
intended provider or shared changes; never absorb unrelated user edits to
satisfy a preferred boundary.

## Consequential decisions and deferrals

Implementors should proceed autonomously on ordinary provider-specific details.
Defer for user review only when evidence leaves multiple materially different
product directions, including:

- a provider cannot support a useful fixed-installation channel without
  Flue-owned OAuth or installation storage;
- Cloudflare support would require a Node-only runtime, remote proxy, or a
  substantial compatibility layer after official, community, and
  standards-based Fetch paths have been investigated;
- an official protocol depends on a long-lived socket or polling transport and
  no equivalent verified HTTP ingress exists;
- a batch can plausibly map to either one callback or many callbacks with
  materially different acknowledgement, ordering, or failure semantics;
- choosing conversation identity would irreversibly collapse distinct provider
  destinations;
- signature verification requires trusting proxy headers or reconstructed URLs
  without a defensible configuration contract;
- provider response deadlines conflict with Flue dispatch or handler behavior;
- a public package name or route suffix would create a likely long-term naming
  mistake;
- official documentation and official SDK behavior materially disagree.

When a consequential decision can be deferred without blocking unrelated work:

1. record the evidence and alternatives;
2. implement no accidental public commitment;
3. continue other provider workstreams;
4. leave a concrete review question in the implementation log.

## Deviations

This plan is directional, not immutable. Implementors may deviate when genuinely
new evidence from official provider sources, the codebase, target-runtime
testing, or review shows that another approach better satisfies the product
invariants.

Record every material deviation with:

- the planned assumption;
- the new evidence;
- alternatives considered;
- the chosen direction and reasoning;
- public API, documentation, test, and target impact;
- whether user review is still required.

Do not use deviation permission for unrecorded feature expansion, copying the
reference repository, or unrelated refactors.

## Implementation log

### GitHub — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes issue and pull-request
  conversation comments, inline pull-request review comments, mentions, and
  broad outbound message operations.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- GitHub webhook signature validation documentation.
- GitHub webhook best practices and ten-second response requirement.
- GitHub webhook event and payload documentation.
- Official `@octokit/webhooks-types` declarations for current required payload
  fields.
- Official Octokit REST declarations and package metadata.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All normalized types, synthetic payloads, fake ids, assertions, and tests
  were designed from GitHub's official documentation and Flue's existing
  channel contract. Nothing was copied or translated from Chat SDK source or
  tests.

Decisions:

- Keep one `POST /webhook` surface and the existing fixed-webhook constructor.
- Add `pull_request_review_comment.created` as the missing message-like inbound
  family.
- Add typed sender information and enough issue, pull-request, and comment
  context to implement mention-driven dispatch without reading `raw`.
- Keep inline review comments in the containing pull request's existing
  canonical Flue conversation identity. Expose the top-level review-comment id
  so applications that need inline replies can bind that capability
  explicitly.
- Add a default and maximum nine-second application handler deadline, leaving
  one second before GitHub's documented ten-second connection deadline.
- Continue accepting both official JSON and form-encoded webhook payloads.
- Keep Octokit as the project-owned outbound client. Its typed
  `issues.createComment()` path executes in workerd through Fetch without
  `nodejs_compat`.

Tests:

- Existing exact-byte HMAC, malformed input, response, identity, and workerd
  coverage retained.
- Added original synthetic issue-comment and pull-request-review-comment
  payloads with distinct ids and text, including top-level and reply thread-id
  behavior.
- Added handler deadline coverage.
- Added a permanent workerd test for Octokit's real typed request construction
  against a fake Fetch transport.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, Node tests, and workerd tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, workerd outbound-client test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass.
- A built Node server returns an empty `200` for an original valid signed
  delivery and `401` for an invalid signature.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes.
- Prepared publish docs were regenerated.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license, and prepared docs without an outbound client or tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  sees the named review-comment reference type.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider diff for verification ordering, malformed
  payload handling, normalized event narrowing, response deadlines, response
  serialization, public declarations, Cloudflare execution, and documentation.
- Replaced an awkward emitted nested-property comment with a named public
  review-comment reference and added the missing top-level thread-id contract
  test.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial brief left event expansion open. Official GitHub and high-level
  reference documentation showed that inline review comments are a distinct
  webhook family required for the intended comment-driven channel, so the
  package now normalizes that family.

Deferrals:

- None.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level GitHub adapter README and capability
  matrix after implementation; no reference source or test files were used.
- Issue and pull-request conversation comments and inline review comments are
  represented as verified ingress.
- Flue deliberately keeps one canonical conversation identity at the
  containing issue or pull request rather than creating a separate agent
  identity for each inline review-comment thread. The normalized top-level
  review-comment id still enables application-owned inline replies.
- Mention detection and response policy remain application behavior over the
  normalized sender and comment fields.
- Posting, editing, deleting, reactions, history, enterprise API endpoints, and
  other broad outbound capabilities remain available through the
  project-owned Octokit client rather than a Flue abstraction.
- PAT and GitHub App credential selection, installation-client caching,
  multi-tenant installation lookup, OAuth, and durable installation state are
  outside this fixed-installation ingress package. Signed payload installation
  ids are exposed for applications that need them.
- No justified ingress gap remains.

### Slack — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

#### Native-payload audit direction — 2026-06-13

The channel policy changed after reviewing the cost of Flue-owned event
normalization. Provider-native payloads and authoritative provider types are
now the default across first-party channels. Existing channels will be audited
provider by provider rather than rewritten mechanically.

Slack decisions:

- Replace the custom normalized Events API union with Slack's official
  `@slack/types` `SlackEvent` and re-export the provider type.
- Change the Events API callback to `events({ c, payload })`, where `payload`
  is the provider-native outer Events API envelope and users access
  `payload.event`.
- Forward every authenticated Events API delivery to application code,
  including bot messages and message subtypes. Only package-owned protocol
  handshakes such as URL verification bypass the callback.
- Preserve Slack field names, nesting, and native `type` and `subtype`
  discriminants. Remove Flue's known/unknown event registry, camel-cased event
  payload, retry normalization, and message filtering.
- Validate only signature, timestamp, body and encoding, configured app and
  workspace identity, enterprise-install policy, envelope routing, and the
  minimal structure needed to call the handler. Do not attempt exhaustive
  runtime validation of Slack's official event union.
- Use small provider-wire local types for interactions, commands, and the
  Events API envelope where lightweight official types are unavailable. Do not
  depend on the full `@slack/bolt` framework solely for its types.
- Apply the same native-payload policy during the remaining channel audits,
  preferring official provider packages, SDK exports, generated schemas, or
  maintained DefinitelyTyped packages before defining Flue-owned types.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes Events API messages and
  mentions, slash commands, Block Kit interactions, shortcuts, modals,
  single-workspace and multi-workspace OAuth modes, Socket Mode, and broad Web
  API operations.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Slack request-signature verification documentation.
- Slack Events API envelope, retry, authorization, and acknowledgement
  documentation.
- Slack `url_verification` event reference.
- Slack slash-command implementation and payload documentation.
- Slack interaction acknowledgement and payload references for block actions,
  views, shortcuts, and block suggestions.
- Official `@slack/web-api` v8 release-candidate declarations, package source,
  and npm metadata.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All normalized types, synthetic forms and JSON payloads, fake ids, assertions,
  and tests were designed from Slack's official documentation and Flue's
  existing channel contract. Nothing was copied or translated from Chat SDK
  source or tests.

Decisions:

- Keep the fixed-application, fixed-workspace v1 boundary and explicitly reject
  org-wide installations. OAuth installation storage and Socket Mode remain
  outside the HTTP channel package.
- Add optional `POST /commands` ingress alongside the existing optional
  `/events` and `/interactions` surfaces.
- Accept Slack's signed URL-verification challenge without requiring app or
  workspace fields that Slack does not send in that payload.
- Normalize configured app identity for interaction variants that do not send
  `api_app_id`, while rejecting a mismatched id when one is present.
- Expand known interactions to message- or view-based block actions, view
  submissions and closures, global and message shortcuts, and block
  suggestions. Continue forwarding other verified variants as explicit
  unknown interactions.
- Expose `trigger_id`, `response_url`, and view response URLs under an explicit
  short-lived `capabilities` object with a hard documentation boundary against
  dispatch, model context, logging, and persistence.
- Keep the Fetch-based official `@slack/web-api` v8 release candidate as the
  project-owned outbound client, subject to the existing real workerd
  execution gate with `nodejs_compat`.

Tests:

- Retained exact-byte HMAC, timestamp, body limit, response, retry, identity,
  event, interaction, and canonical-thread coverage.
- Added original synthetic slash-command forms, identity and org-install
  rejection, identity-free URL verification, global shortcuts without
  `api_app_id`, view-origin actions, view closures, block suggestions, and
  workerd execution of commands and shortcuts.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, Node tests, and workerd tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, real `WebClient` workerd test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass.
- A built Node server returns the documented URL-verification challenge for an
  original valid signed request without app/workspace fields and returns `401`
  for an invalid signature.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies the generated Slack
  recipe includes the optional commands route.
- Prepared publish docs were regenerated.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license, and prepared docs without an outbound client or tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows slash-command and expanded interaction variants.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider diff for exact-byte verification, replay
  window, identity boundaries, org-install rejection, form parsing, capability
  handling, acknowledgement deadlines, response serialization, public
  declarations, and Cloudflare execution.
- Corrected three pre-existing protocol assumptions found during review:
  URL-verification payloads do not contain app/workspace identity, shortcuts
  may omit `api_app_id`, and block actions may originate from views without
  message context.
- Aligned new active-suite test names with repository conventions.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

#### Native-payload implementation follow-up — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Implemented:

- Replaced Flue's normalized Slack Events API model with the provider-native
  outer delivery envelope and the official `@slack/types@3.0.0-rc.1`
  `SlackEvent` union, re-exported from `@flue/slack`.
- Changed callbacks to `events({ c, payload })`,
  `interactions({ c, payload })`, and `commands({ c, payload })`.
- Removed event normalization, camel-cased mirrors, retry normalization,
  interaction capability wrappers, and bot/message-subtype filtering.
- Preserved Slack JSON and form field names and nesting. Added narrow local
  wire types for interaction and command surfaces because no lightweight
  authoritative package exposes those complete callback payloads.
- Kept URL verification internal. Other authenticated event deliveries,
  including bot messages, message subtypes, Assistant events, rate-limit
  notifications, and unmodeled nested event discriminants, reach application
  code.
- Kept retry metadata in the authentic Hono request headers rather than
  copying it into a Flue event model.
- Updated the editable example, package README, connector recipe, API
  reference, ecosystem guide, and foundational Channels guide. Outbound reply,
  Assistant status, and streaming examples are explicitly Slack Web API SDK
  capabilities rather than Flue channel features.

Tests:

- Replaced normalized-event assertions with native payload pass-through
  coverage for Events API envelopes, official Assistant-event narrowing, bot
  messages, message subtypes, reactions, future event discriminants,
  `app_rate_limited`, multi-action interactions, future interaction types, and
  snake_case slash-command forms.
- Retained and expanded signature, replay window, identity, org-install,
  malformed transport, body limit, response, timeout, optional route, and
  conversation-key behavior.
- Workerd executes exact-byte verification and native Events API, shortcut,
  and command callbacks.
- The editable example executes `chat.postMessage`,
  `assistant.threads.setStatus`, and `chatStream()` start/append/stop requests
  through fake Fetch responses in workerd without contacting Slack.
- The real `flue add` suite now asserts that the Slack recipe teaches the
  provider-native callback contract.

Validation:

- `@flue/slack` build, strict typecheck, 21 Node tests, and 2 workerd tests
  pass.
- The Slack example strict typecheck, 3 real-client workerd tests, Node build,
  and Cloudflare build pass. The Cloudflare build reports only the example's
  existing missing Durable Object migration warning.
- A generated Node server returns the documented URL-verification challenge
  for a valid original signed request and `401` for the same signature over
  tampered bytes.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- `scripts/prepare-publish.mjs` completes successfully.
- The packed package contains the expected runtime, declarations, README,
  license, and prepared docs. Its package metadata includes direct
  `@slack/types` and Hono dependencies and no outbound SDK.
- A clean offline strict TypeScript consumer installs the tarball, compiles a
  custom Hono environment, narrows official Assistant and message events,
  consumes interaction and command types, and imports the constructor at
  runtime.

Deviation and foundation improvement:

- The generated Node smoke test found that the built Flue server rejected a
  valid channel `Response` created by the external package because
  `instanceof Response` is realm-sensitive across the bundle/package
  boundary. This was new evidence not captured by the plan.
- Replaced that shared runtime assertion with a Fetch response brand check and
  added a routing regression test. Applied the same realm-safe check to
  Slack's callback result serializer so Hono or Fetch responses from the
  application are not rejected across the same boundary.
- This is a concrete shared channel-foundation correction, not a Slack
  abstraction. No broader payload or routing machinery changed.

Clean-room affirmation:

- The implementation, local wire types, synthetic payloads, and assertions
  were derived from Slack's official protocol/type surfaces and existing Flue
  contracts. No Chat SDK implementation, types, tests, fixtures, or submitted
  PR code were copied or translated.

Independent review:

- One read-only subagent reviewed correctness, security, provider-native
  semantics, TypeScript DX, Node/Cloudflare behavior, and documentation
  consistency without spawning subagents.
- The reviewer correctly identified that accepting a cross-realm response by
  tag and shape alone could pass a spoofed object downstream. The final
  implementation now validates the response metadata and normalizes foreign
  responses into a new local Fetch `Response`; bare tagged objects are rejected
  in both shared routing and Slack callback serialization.
- The reviewer also identified current official Bolt interaction families that
  were missing from the local wire union. Added legacy interactive-message
  actions and suggestions, dialog submissions and suggestions, and deprecated
  workflow-step edit payloads, plus narrowing/pass-through coverage for dialog
  submissions.
- The broader observation that future provider discriminants can exceed an
  installed closed TypeScript union is retained as an intentional policy
  tradeoff. Flue forwards authenticated future payloads rather than filtering
  them or inventing a custom `unknown` discriminant. The API reference states
  this runtime behavior; users update provider/channel types for new
  discriminants.
- After the fixes, package tests, workerd tests, all 659 runtime tests, example
  tests/builds, docs checks/build, connector tests, built-server smoke,
  prepared artifacts, packed tarball, and clean strict consumer pass.

Deviations:

- None.

Deferrals:

- OAuth, installation storage, token rotation, Socket Mode, and long-lived
  transports remain outside the fixed-workspace HTTP package.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Slack adapter README, capability matrix,
  and adapter registry after implementation; no reference source or test files
  were used.
- Events API messages and mentions, slash commands, block actions, external
  select suggestions, modal submissions and closures, and global/message
  shortcuts are represented as verified HTTP ingress.
- Other signed Events API and interaction variants remain available through
  explicit unknown variants instead of forcing a prematurely exhaustive event
  registry.
- Posting, editing, deleting, reactions, files, streaming, history, custom API
  endpoints, and other broad outbound capabilities remain available through
  the project-owned `WebClient` rather than a Flue abstraction.
- Token rotation and dynamic client selection remain application-owned client
  initialization concerns.
- Multi-workspace OAuth, installation storage, token encryption, org-wide
  installs, Socket Mode, and socket forwarding remain deliberately outside the
  fixed-workspace HTTP package.
- No justified fixed-workspace HTTP ingress gap remains.

### Discord — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes HTTP interactions for
  commands and components, Gateway delivery for ordinary messages and
  reactions, and broad outbound messaging, files, reactions, typing, and
  history operations.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Discord interaction overview and receiving/responding documentation.
- Discord application-command type and autocomplete documentation.
- Discord interaction context, installation owner, locale, token lifetime,
  and response deadline documentation.
- Current `discord-api-types` declarations and generated runtime package for
  interaction payload and REST route contracts.
- Current `@discordjs/rest` 2.6.1 export map, declarations, and Fetch-based web
  implementation.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All normalized types, synthetic payloads, generated keys and signatures,
  fake ids, assertions, and tests were designed from Discord's official
  documentation, current provider declarations, and Flue's existing channel
  contract. Nothing was copied or translated from Chat SDK source or tests.

Decisions:

- Keep one `POST /interactions` surface with exact-byte Ed25519 verification,
  fixed application identity, internal PING/PONG, required provider responses,
  and the existing 2.5-second application deadline.
- Add typed autocomplete interactions and support chat-input, user, message,
  and primary-entry-point application-command data.
- Preserve component message context, command target/resolved data, modal
  resolved data, and current scalar or list modal field values without
  duplicating Discord's complete payload type system.
- Normalize invoking user, locale, interaction context, and authorizing
  installation owners. Allow `destination` to be absent when Discord does not
  supply enough channel context, and represent private-channel identity
  without implying bot-token posting authority.
- Move the interaction token under an explicit short-lived `capabilities`
  object. Keep `raw` capability-bearing and document both values out of
  dispatch input, model context, logs, and persistence.
- Preserve the existing guild channel/thread conversation-key format. Add a
  private-channel key without changing existing guild or bot-DM keys.
- Keep Gateway, ordinary messages, reactions, and long-lived transports
  outside the HTTP channel.
- Keep `@discordjs/rest` as the project-owned outbound client. Its package-root
  conditional export executes with global Fetch in workerd. Use
  `discord-api-types` as a type-only dependency in Worker-facing canonical
  code and construct the documented REST route locally.

Tests:

- Expanded original synthetic signed payloads for all application-command
  types, autocomplete, component message context, destination-free modals,
  modern scalar and list modal values, private channels, installation owners,
  locale, user identity, contradictory identity, and capability placement.
- Retained Node and workerd exact-byte Ed25519 verification, application
  identity, response, timeout, and canonical-key coverage.
- Added a real `@discordjs/rest` workerd execution test against a fake Fetch
  transport, with no successful provider request.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, Node tests, and workerd tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, real REST-client workerd test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass.
- A built Node server returns the typed response for an original valid signed
  autocomplete interaction and returns `401` for a body changed after signing.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes.
- Prepared publish docs were regenerated.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license, and prepared docs without an outbound client or tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows autocomplete, capabilities, optional destinations, and
  private-channel references.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider diff for exact-byte verification, identity
  consistency, optional destination semantics, command and interaction
  narrowing, capability handling, required responses, deadlines, public
  declarations, and Cloudflare execution.
- Restored the existing guild channel/thread conversation-key shape after
  finding that an intermediate simplification would have unnecessarily changed
  durable thread identities.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial example used runtime `Routes` and response-enum imports from
  `discord-api-types`. Its runtime ESM wrapper did not expose `Routes` in the
  workerd execution spike, so canonical Worker-facing code now uses type-only
  provider imports and the documented REST path string.
- The first workerd client spike installed its fake global Fetch after the SDK
  had captured Fetch during static module initialization. One request using
  the literal dummy token `discord-test-token` reached Discord and returned
  `401`; no real credential or successful remote operation was involved. The
  permanent test installs the fake before dynamically importing the SDK and
  now remains fully local.

Deferrals:

- Discord Gateway, ordinary messages and mentions, reactions, typing, presence,
  voice, and other long-lived event delivery remain outside the HTTP channel.
- OAuth installation flows, dynamic multi-installation credentials, command
  registration, interaction follow-up storage, and durable deduplication remain
  application concerns.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Discord adapter README after
  implementation; no reference source or test files were used.
- Slash commands and other application commands, autocomplete, buttons and
  other components, and modal submissions are represented as verified HTTP
  ingress.
- Regular messages, mentions, reactions, and role-mention policy require
  Gateway delivery and remain deliberately outside this serverless HTTP
  channel.
- Posting, editing, deleting, files, reactions, typing, history, embeds,
  buttons, and other broad outbound capabilities remain available through the
  project-owned REST client rather than a Flue abstraction.
- No justified HTTP-interaction ingress gap remains.

### Microsoft Teams — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes Bot Framework activities,
  mentions, Adaptive Cards and modals, reactions, direct and group
  conversations, broad outbound messaging, streaming, files, typing,
  Microsoft Graph user lookup, and message history.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Microsoft Bot Connector incoming-request authentication and endorsement
  documentation.
- Microsoft Bot Connector send-and-receive REST documentation.
- Microsoft Teams bot conversation and activity documentation.
- Microsoft Teams resource-specific consent and message-delivery
  documentation.
- Microsoft 365 Agents SDK authentication documentation.
- Official `@microsoft/agents-hosting`, `@microsoft/teams.apps`, and
  `@microsoft/agents-activity` package metadata and declarations.
- Microsoft public-cloud OpenID metadata and endorsed JWKS document.
- `jose` package exports and Web API runtime declarations.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All normalized activity types, synthetic payloads, generated RSA keys and
  JWTs, fake ids, assertions, OAuth responses, and Connector requests were
  designed from Microsoft primary sources and Flue's existing channel
  contract. Nothing was copied or translated from Chat SDK source, types,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/teams` and `flue add teams` with one
  `POST /channels/<file>/activities` surface.
- Keep a fixed-application, fixed-host-tenant v1 boundary. Bot Connector JWT
  audience constrains the application; authenticated conversation and channel
  tenant fields constrain the Teams tenant. Sender account tenant ids are not
  forced to match because guest and shared-channel users may belong to another
  tenant.
- Verify `RS256` Bot Connector tokens through configurable OpenID metadata,
  require the configured issuer and audience plus expiration, require the
  selected signing key's `msteams` endorsement, and compare the activity
  `serviceUrl` exactly with the signed `serviceurl` claim.
- Cache bounded OpenID/JWKS results and imported Web Crypto keys. Refresh once
  for an unknown key id with a cooldown that prevents unbounded attacker-driven
  discovery requests.
- Normalize message, conversation-update, invoke, and message-reaction
  activities. Preserve other authenticated activity types as explicit unknown
  variants.
- Expose Teams account, mention, conversation, team, channel, thread, bot, and
  verified Connector service identities needed for dispatch and outbound
  routing.
- Keep normal Hono and Fetch response behavior: `undefined` becomes an empty
  `200`, JSON-compatible values become JSON responses, and `Response` values
  pass through. Use a default and maximum 4.5-second application deadline so
  invoke handlers complete before Teams' documented five-second response
  window.
- Do not use Microsoft's current JavaScript hosting SDKs in the canonical
  recipe. `@microsoft/agents-hosting` and `@microsoft/teams.apps` declare Node
  runtimes and depend on Node-oriented MSAL, JWT, HTTP, or Express stacks.
- Provide a project-owned Fetch client that performs tenant-specific OAuth
  client credentials and Bot Connector REST message requests. The client is
  application code, not an outbound abstraction exported by `@flue/teams`.
- Retain the verified Connector `serviceUrl` and bot id in the conversation
  reference so the canonical example remains stateless. Conversation keys
  remain syntax-only identifiers and the example agent remains dispatch-only.
- Support public-cloud defaults plus explicit OpenID metadata, issuer, and
  OAuth-authority overrides for a supported sovereign deployment.

Tests:

- Added original synthetic activities with distinct application, tenant,
  conversation, team, channel, thread, user, and bot ids.
- Generated RSA keys and signed Bot Connector JWTs locally for valid,
  malformed, expired, wrong-audience, unknown-key, rotated-key, unendorsed,
  service-URL mismatch, channel mismatch, and tenant mismatch coverage.
- Covered messages and mentions, attachments, invokes, conversation updates,
  reactions, unknown variants, external-user tenant identity, response
  serialization, Hono status control, handler failure and timeout, body limits,
  media types, discovery failure, and canonical-key round trips.
- Added permanent workerd execution of `jose` RSA/JWT/JWKS verification.
- Added permanent workerd execution of the project-owned OAuth and Connector
  Fetch client against an injected local transport, including token reuse and
  exact request construction.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, Node tests, and workerd tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, workerd outbound-client test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass. Both builds discover exactly one `teams` channel.
- A built Node server returned empty `200` for an original locally signed
  authenticated activity and `401` for an invalid bearer token while using a
  local HTTPS OpenID/JWKS server.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies the Teams recipe and
  Workers-compatible Fetch path.
- Prepared publish docs were generated for all public packages.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license metadata, and prepared docs without an outbound client or
  model tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows Teams activity variants and conversation references.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider diff for JWT verification ordering, issuer
  and audience checks, key endorsements, exact service URL trust, tenant
  boundaries, key rotation, discovery failure, activity narrowing, response
  behavior, canonical identity, outbound token handling, Cloudflare execution,
  declarations, and documentation.
- Corrected the initial tenant check so an authenticated guest or
  shared-channel sender may have an account tenant different from the fixed
  host conversation tenant.
- Increased only the trusted discovery-document limit from 1 MiB to 4 MiB
  after the live Microsoft public JWKS measured approximately 967 KB. The
  activity body limit remains 1 MiB.
- Moved the project-owned Fetch helper out of the immediate `channels/`
  directory after real builds correctly discovered every file there as a
  channel module.
- Added imported-key caching and an unknown-key refresh cooldown after
  reviewing the cost and denial-of-service implications of Microsoft's large
  JWKS.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial brief preferred an official or established outbound SDK when
  possible. Current official JavaScript packages are explicitly Node-oriented
  and failed the required runtime-dependency audit, while Microsoft documents
  a small standards-based OAuth and Connector REST path. The canonical recipe
  therefore uses project-owned Fetch code on both Node and Cloudflare.
- The initial generic discovery limit matched the 1 MiB activity body limit.
  Current primary-source evidence showed that Microsoft key discovery already
  approaches that size, so discovery uses a separate 4 MiB cap.

Deferrals:

- Multi-tenant application installation, OAuth consent, credential selection,
  token encryption, and durable installation state remain outside this
  fixed-tenant channel.
- Federated workload identity is an application-owned alternative token source;
  the canonical cross-platform recipe uses a client secret.
- Microsoft Graph user lookup, message history, channel enumeration, and their
  delegated, application, or resource-specific permissions remain
  application-owned outbound behavior.
- Editing and deleting messages, file uploads, typing, streaming, Adaptive Card
  construction, proactive conversation creation, and other broad outbound
  behavior remain additions to the project-owned client rather than Flue
  package API.
- No live Teams tenant, Azure Bot registration, or provider credential was used
  in automated or manual validation.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Teams adapter README and root capability
  statement after implementation; no reference source, declarations, sample
  messages, or tests were used.
- Messages and mentions, conversation updates, Adaptive Card or modal invokes,
  and received reactions are represented as authenticated HTTP ingress.
- Buttons, cards, and modals are invoke payload and response policy over the
  normalized activity rather than separate Flue route surfaces.
- Direct messages, group chats, channels, and channel threads are represented
  in the normalized destination model.
- Receiving all channel or group-chat messages is Teams application
  registration and resource-specific consent configuration, documented in the
  guide rather than package behavior.
- Posting is demonstrated by the project-owned Fetch client. Editing, deleting,
  files, typing, streaming, history, Graph user lookup, channel lookup, and
  other broad outbound capabilities remain application behavior.
- Multi-tenant and federated credential modes remain application installation
  and token-source concerns outside the fixed-tenant HTTP ingress package.
- No justified authenticated HTTP ingress gap remains.

### Google Chat — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes direct Google Chat
  interactions, optional Pub/Sub delivery for broader space events,
  service-account authentication, messages and mentions, card actions,
  direct messages, reactions, and broad outbound messaging and history
  operations.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, package declarations,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Google Chat request-verification documentation for endpoint-URL and
  project-number token modes.
- Google Chat interaction-event, event-type, and synchronous-response
  documentation.
- Google Workspace Events documentation for Chat event types, CloudEvent
  attributes, lifecycle events, and Pub/Sub delivery.
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub authenticated-push token verification documentation.
- Google service-account OAuth JWT assertion and token-exchange documentation.
- Google Chat API application-authentication and `spaces.messages.create`
  documentation.
- Current `google-auth-library` package metadata and dependency declarations.
- `jose` package Web API exports and workerd execution.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All public types, normalized event families, synthetic direct interactions,
  Pub/Sub envelopes, generated RSA keys and tokens, certificate fixtures, fake
  ids, assertions, and tests were designed from Google primary sources and
  Flue's existing channel contract. Nothing was copied or translated from Chat
  SDK source, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample
  messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/google-chat` and `flue add google-chat`.
- Publish `POST /channels/<file>/interactions` when a direct interaction
  handler is configured and `POST /channels/<file>/events` only when a
  Workspace Events handler is configured.
- Support both documented direct authentication modes:
  Google OIDC tokens addressed to the exact HTTPS endpoint URL and Google Chat
  service tokens addressed to the numeric project number.
- Verify direct endpoint tokens against Google's `RS256` JWKS, issuer,
  audience, expiration, verified email, and
  `chat@system.gserviceaccount.com` identity. Verify project-number tokens
  against the Chat service-account issuer, numeric audience, and X509
  certificates.
- Verify Pub/Sub OIDC tokens independently against the configured audience and
  push service-account identity. Also require the exact Pub/Sub subscription
  resource in the push body before forwarding a Workspace Event.
- Cache imported JWKS and X509 keys with provider cache metadata, refresh once
  for an unknown key id, and apply a cooldown only to repeated unknown-key
  refreshes rather than initial discovery.
- Normalize direct messages, app space membership, card clicks, app commands,
  app-home requests, and form submissions. Preserve other authenticated direct
  types as explicit unknown variants.
- Normalize message, membership, reaction, space, and subscription-lifecycle
  Workspace Event families while retaining CloudEvent attributes, Pub/Sub
  message identity, decoded event data, and explicit unknown variants.
- Validate Workspace Event source, subject, Chat resource relationship, and
  lifecycle source/subject identity before application behavior.
- Use canonical conversation keys based only on stable space and optional
  thread resource names. `spaceType` remains descriptive metadata and cannot
  split one destination into different agent instances.
- Keep normal Hono and Fetch response behavior. `undefined` becomes an empty
  `200`, JSON-compatible values become JSON responses, and `Response` values
  pass through. Bound direct interaction handlers to a default 25-second and
  maximum 30-second deadline.
- Do not use `google-auth-library` in the canonical cross-platform recipe. Its
  current package declares Node support and depends on Node-oriented
  authentication and HTTP packages.
- Provide a project-owned `jose` and Fetch client that signs a service-account
  JWT assertion, exchanges it for a `chat.bot` access token, caches the token,
  and posts to the trusted space and optional thread through Chat REST.

Tests:

- Added original direct interaction values with distinct app URLs, project
  numbers, spaces, threads, users, commands, actions, forms, and unknown
  variants.
- Generated OIDC RSA keys and tokens locally for valid, wrong-identity, cached,
  and rotated-key coverage. Added an original locally generated X509
  certificate and private key for project-number verification.
- Covered every normalized direct family, explicit unknown interactions,
  provider action-parameter arrays, Hono status control, JSON responses,
  handler failure, media type, body limits, route omission, and canonical-key
  behavior.
- Added original authenticated Pub/Sub push envelopes for message, membership,
  reaction, space, lifecycle, and unknown Workspace Event families.
- Covered Pub/Sub audience and identity verification, exact subscription
  identity, CloudEvent source and subject relationships, decoded data,
  resource destinations, and lifecycle events without invented Chat
  destinations.
- Added permanent workerd execution of direct and Pub/Sub Google OIDC
  verification through both public routes.
- Added permanent workerd execution of the project-owned service-account JWT,
  OAuth exchange, token verification, and threaded Chat REST request against
  an injected local transport.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, 15 Node protocol tests, and workerd ingress
  tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, workerd outbound-client test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass. Both builds discover exactly one `google-chat`
  channel.
- A built Node server returned empty `200` for an original locally signed
  authenticated direct interaction and `401` for an invalid bearer token while
  using a local HTTPS JWKS server.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies both Google Chat route
  comments and the Workers-compatible service-account Fetch path.
- Knip and scoped Biome lint pass. The repository-wide `check:lint` command
  still reports the pre-existing Biome warning backlog in runtime, PostgreSQL,
  and CLI files outside this provider change.
- Prepared publish docs were generated for all public packages.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license metadata, and prepared docs without an outbound client or
  model tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows direct and Workspace Event variants, configures both authentication
  surfaces, and round-trips conversation keys.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider diff for token mode separation, issuer,
  audience, verified identity, key discovery and rotation, Pub/Sub
  subscription identity, CloudEvent trust boundaries, event normalization,
  canonical identity, response behavior, outbound assertion signing,
  Cloudflare execution, declarations, and documentation.
- Corrected action normalization after primary-source review showed that
  Google card action parameters are an array of `{ key, value }` entries rather
  than a JSON object.
- Corrected the unknown-key cooldown so initial discovery does not delay
  legitimate key rotation.
- Removed `spaceType` from canonical keys after finding that optional event
  metadata could otherwise split one stable space or thread identity.
- Required the exact Pub/Sub subscription resource after reviewing the
  difference between authenticated push-caller identity and fixed integration
  identity.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial brief preferred a maintained cross-runtime Google authentication
  implementation when available. The edge-focused packages found during
  research had not been maintained since 2023, while Google's official Node
  client remained Node-oriented. The canonical recipe therefore implements
  the small documented service-account JWT and OAuth exchange directly with
  the same actively maintained cross-runtime `jose` dependency already used
  for verified ingress.
- The high-level reference used one endpoint for direct and Pub/Sub-shaped
  requests. Flue uses separate `/interactions` and optional `/events` suffixes
  so each authentication, payload, retry, and response contract remains
  explicit and independently mountable.

Deferrals:

- Creating, renewing, suspending, and storing Google Workspace Events
  subscriptions remains application-owned lifecycle behavior.
- Domain-wide delegation, delegated-user authentication, impersonation, and
  multi-domain installation state remain outside the fixed-application
  ingress package.
- Editing and deleting messages, reactions, direct-message creation, message
  history, thread and space listing, cards, streaming fallbacks, and broader
  Chat API behavior remain additions to the project-owned client rather than
  `@flue/google-chat`.
- The canonical client uses app authentication and `chat.bot`. Operations that
  require user authorization must use an independently designed
  application-owned user credential path.
- No live Chat app, Google Cloud project, Pub/Sub subscription, Workspace
  Events subscription, service-account credential, or provider request was
  used in automated or manual validation.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Google Chat adapter README and root
  capability statement after implementation; no reference source,
  declarations, fixtures, payloads, sample messages, or tests were used.
- Direct messages to the app, mentions, app membership changes, card actions,
  app commands, app-home requests, and form submissions are represented as
  authenticated direct interaction ingress.
- Broader messages, memberships, reactions, space changes, and subscription
  lifecycle events are represented as authenticated Workspace Events delivered
  through Pub/Sub push.
- Buttons, selects, forms, dialogs, cards, and other rich interaction details
  remain provider payload and response policy over normalized direct events
  rather than separate Flue routes or abstractions.
- Posting is demonstrated by the project-owned service-account Fetch client.
  Editing, deleting, reactions, history, direct-message creation, rich card
  construction, and other broad outbound operations remain application
  behavior.
- Domain-wide delegation and user-authenticated operations remain application
  credential and authorization concerns.
- No justified authenticated HTTP ingress gap remains.

### Linear — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes issue comments, nested
  comment replies, app-actor agent sessions, several credential and
  installation modes, reactions, activity progress, and broad Linear API
  behavior.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, package declarations,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Linear webhook delivery, retry, payload, signature, timestamp, and source-IP
  documentation.
- Linear SDK webhook-helper documentation and current
  `@linear/sdk@86.0.0` declarations and package source.
- Linear agent interaction and agent-session webhook documentation.
- Linear's current public GraphQL and webhook SDL.
- Linear's official Cloudflare Workers weather-agent example, including its
  `@linear/sdk` and `nodejs_compat` deployment configuration.
- Current `@linear/sdk` npm metadata and dependency declarations.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All public types, normalized event families, synthetic webhook payloads,
  fake ids, timestamps, assertions, and tests were designed from Linear's
  primary sources and Flue's existing channel contract. Nothing was copied or
  translated from Chat SDK source, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, sample messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/linear` and `flue add linear`.
- Publish one `POST /channels/<file>/webhook` route. Ordinary resource events
  and agent-session events use the same signed webhook protocol and Linear
  endpoint configuration, so separate Flue route surfaces would create
  artificial setup complexity.
- Verify the exact raw request bytes with Web Crypto HMAC-SHA256 before
  parsing, then require the signed `webhookTimestamp` within Linear's
  documented one-minute replay window.
- Accept optional fixed `organizationId` and `webhookId` constraints while
  allowing an application that already owns multi-organization installation
  state to route all payloads authorized by one signing secret.
- Normalize comment, issue, project, and agent-session families. Preserve
  unsupported verified resource types or actions as an explicit unknown
  event.
- Preserve the header-derived `Linear-Delivery` id for application-owned
  deduplication while documenting that Linear signs the body rather than this
  transport header.
- Validate nested agent-session organization, app-user, and activity-session
  identities against the signed top-level payload before invoking application
  code.
- Model top-level issue comments as the issue conversation. Model replies with
  the signed parent/root comment id. Model agent sessions with their stable
  session id; narrowed event variants expose the corresponding narrowed
  conversation type.
- Keep normal Hono and Fetch response behavior: `undefined` becomes an empty
  `200`, JSON-compatible values become JSON responses, and `Response` values
  pass through. Use a default and maximum 4.5-second application deadline
  before Linear's documented five-second delivery deadline.
- Keep the official `@linear/sdk` as the project-owned outbound client. The
  canonical example supports personal API keys or pre-obtained OAuth access
  tokens and demonstrates issue comments and agent-session response
  activities.
- Require `nodejs_compat` for the official SDK in workerd. This is a supported
  path demonstrated by Linear's own Workers example and is already part of
  Flue's Cloudflare target.

Tests:

- Added original synthetic comments, replies, issues, projects, unknown
  resources, created agent sessions, and prompted agent sessions with distinct
  organizations, webhooks, sessions, issues, comments, users, and activities.
- Covered exact-byte HMAC verification, malformed signatures, stale and future
  timestamps, media types, body limits, fixed identity mismatches, malformed
  known payloads, nested agent-session identity mismatches, response
  serialization, Hono status control, handler failure and timeout, and
  canonical-key round trips.
- Added permanent workerd verification of exact HMAC bytes and agent-session
  normalization without Node compatibility.
- Added permanent workerd execution of the real official `LinearClient` with
  `nodejs_compat`, exercising comment and agent-activity GraphQL requests
  against an injected fake Fetch transport.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, 15 Node protocol tests, and workerd ingress
  tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, real `LinearClient` workerd test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass. Both builds discover exactly one `linear` channel.
- A built Node server returned empty `200` for an original locally signed
  delivery and `401` for the same body with an invalid signature.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The website connector build emits `/cli/connectors/linear.md`.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies the Linear route,
  official SDK dependency, and Workers compatibility guidance.
- Knip, scoped Biome lint, and whitespace validation pass.
- Prepared publish docs were generated for all public packages.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license metadata, and prepared docs without an outbound SDK client or
  model tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows comment and agent-session events plus their conversation identities.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider diff for exact-byte verification, replay
  protection, fixed and nested identity boundaries, event normalization,
  unknown forwarding, response deadlines, canonical identity, official SDK
  execution in workerd, declarations, and documentation.
- Tightened agent-session nested identity relationships before application
  invocation.
- Narrowed known event conversation types after packed-consumer validation
  showed that agent-session users otherwise had to repeat a redundant type
  check.
- Corrected top-level comment identity after the final capability audit and
  primary schema review showed that only comments with `parentId` belong to a
  nested comment thread.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial brief suggested using official verification helpers where
  useful. The current SDK helper imports Node crypto, while Linear's security
  contract is a small exact-body HMAC and timestamp check. `@flue/linear`
  implements that contract directly with Web Crypto so ingress needs no
  compatibility flag; the official SDK remains the project-owned outbound
  client under its Linear-demonstrated Workers configuration.
- The initial brief asked whether ordinary and agent-session events need
  separate optional route surfaces. Primary-source setup and payload evidence
  showed that both are selected categories on one signed webhook endpoint, so
  the package intentionally exposes one route and one handler.

Deferrals:

- OAuth authorization and callback routes, token refresh, client-credentials
  exchange, token encryption, organization-to-token lookup, and durable
  installation state remain application-owned.
- Multi-tenant applications may omit the fixed organization constraint, but
  they must independently resolve and authorize the correct outbound client.
- Agent activity policy, ephemeral thoughts, plans, external URLs, elicitation,
  stop-signal behavior, editing, deletion, reactions, history, issue and
  project queries, and broader GraphQL operations remain application behavior
  through the project-owned SDK.
- No live Linear workspace, OAuth application, webhook, API credential, or
  provider request was used in automated or manual validation.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Linear adapter README after
  implementation; no reference source, declarations, fixtures, payloads,
  sample messages, or tests were used.
- Issue comments and nested reply threads are represented as verified ingress
  with stable issue identities. Mention detection remains application policy
  over the normalized actor and comment body.
- App-actor session creation and follow-up prompts are represented as verified
  ingress with stable agent-session identity, prompt context, activity,
  guidance, and previous-comment context where supplied.
- Posting to issue conversations and agent sessions is demonstrated with the
  project-owned official SDK client.
- Reactions, typing/progress activities, plans, streaming policy, edits,
  deletion, message history, issue and project lookup, and other broad API
  capabilities remain project-owned SDK behavior rather than Flue
  abstractions.
- Personal API keys and pre-obtained OAuth tokens are demonstrated.
  Client-credentials and multi-tenant OAuth modes remain application
  credential and installation-state concerns.
- No justified verified HTTP ingress gap remains.

### Telegram — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The high-level adapter documentation describes Bot API webhooks, optional
  polling, messages and mentions, inline-keyboard callbacks, reactions,
  typing, edits, deletion, uploads, rich outbound formatting, and
  process-local cached history.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, package declarations,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Telegram Bot API 10.1 `Update`, `Message`, callback-query, reaction,
  `setWebhook`, `getUpdates`, `sendMessage`, business-message, guest-mode,
  forum-topic, and channel direct-message-topic documentation.
- Telegram's official webhook guide and Bot FAQ for delivery, retry,
  duplicate, and webhook-versus-polling behavior.
- Current grammY Cloudflare Workers deployment documentation.
- Current `grammy@1.43.0` and `@grammyjs/types@3.27.3` package metadata,
  declarations, browser export, and official package source.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All public types, normalized update families, synthetic webhook values,
  fake ids, timestamps, assertions, and tests were designed from Telegram's
  primary sources and Flue's existing channel contract. Nothing was copied or
  translated from Chat SDK source, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, sample messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/telegram` and `flue add telegram`.
- Publish one `POST /channels/<file>/webhook` route. Telegram sends one
  JSON-serialized `Update` per webhook request.
- Require the documented `secret_token` even though Telegram makes it
  optional. Verify `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` before body parsing using
  fixed-length Web Crypto digests.
- Do not imply body-signature, timestamp, or replay protection that Telegram
  does not provide. Expose `updateId` for application-owned ordering and
  duplicate admission, and document that secrets must not be reused across
  bots.
- Normalize ordinary and edited messages, channel posts, business messages,
  guest messages, callback queries, individual reactions, and aggregate
  reaction counts. Preserve exactly one unsupported verified Update field as
  an explicit unknown variant.
- Normalize leading bot commands from Telegram's UTF-16 entity offsets and
  preserve the complete verified Update under `raw`.
- Distinguish regular and business chat identity because Telegram documents
  that those chat-id spaces may overlap. Preserve forum-thread and channel
  direct-message-topic identity.
- Do not create durable conversation identity for guest messages.
  `capabilities.guestQueryId` is a short-lived reply capability, not a stable
  destination.
  Inline callback queries similarly omit conversation identity when Telegram
  supplies no accessible message.
- Keep normal Hono and Fetch response behavior: `undefined` becomes an empty
  `200`, JSON-compatible values become webhook response bodies, and
  `Response` values pass through. JSON responses may use Telegram's documented
  webhook-reply Bot API method format.
- Use grammY's full project-owned `Api` client for outbound behavior. Its
  browser/Fetch export executes in Node and workerd without `nodejs_compat`.

Tests:

- Added original synthetic commands, regular and business chats, guest
  messages, accessible and inline callback queries, individual and aggregate
  reactions, unknown updates, and topic identities with distinct fake users,
  chats, messages, callbacks, business connections, and update ids.
- Covered valid, missing, and changed secret headers, content types, body
  limits, malformed and multi-field Update envelopes, required known-payload
  relationships, response serialization, Hono status control, handler
  failure, and canonical-key round trips.
- Added permanent workerd verification of secret-digest comparison and
  channel direct-message-topic normalization without Node compatibility.
- Added permanent workerd execution of the real grammY `Api` browser export,
  exercising regular and business `sendMessage` requests against an injected
  fake Fetch transport without Node compatibility.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, 12 Node protocol tests, and workerd ingress
  tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, real grammY workerd test, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass. Both builds discover exactly one `telegram` channel.
- A built Node server returned empty `200` for an original verified unknown
  delivery and `401` for the same route with a changed secret header.
- Documentation check and production build pass.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies the Telegram route,
  grammY dependency, and Workers compatibility guidance.
- Knip, scoped Biome lint, and whitespace validation pass.
- Prepared publish docs were generated for all public packages.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license metadata, and prepared docs without an outbound client or
  model tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows message and callback variants plus conversation identity.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider implementation for header verification,
  one-Update semantics, known-payload relationships, command offsets, regular
  versus business identity, guest capability boundaries, response behavior,
  grammY workerd execution, declarations, and documentation.
- Moved secret comparison to fixed-length Web Crypto digests.
- Required exactly one accessible or inline message form on callback queries
  and exactly one user or actor-chat form on reaction updates.
- Corrected a test whose low body limit initially masked malformed-envelope
  behavior.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial brief left direct typed Fetch versus a maintained SDK open.
  grammY now publishes an explicit browser/Fetch export, documents Cloudflare
  Workers deployment, and executed its real `Api` client in workerd without
  compatibility flags. The canonical project path therefore exports grammY's
  full client instead of maintaining a narrow Flue example client.
- Telegram permits omitting `secret_token`; Flue requires it because an
  unauthenticated webhook route would violate the verified-ingress product
  boundary.
- The initial brief focused on chats, message threads, users, and forum topics.
  Current Bot API documentation adds business-id collision warnings, guest
  reply capabilities, and channel direct-message topics, so the public
  identity model includes the stable business and direct-topic dimensions and
  intentionally excludes guest capabilities.

Deferrals:

- Webhook registration, deletion, certificate upload, allowed-update
  selection, pending-update policy, and bot-token rotation remain
  application-owned deployment behavior through grammY.
- Long polling and webhook-versus-polling lifecycle control remain outside the
  HTTP channel package.
- Mentions, rich entities, service messages, polls, inline queries, payments,
  membership changes, business-connection lifecycle, purchases, checklists,
  and future Update families remain available through the verified `raw`
  payload or explicit unknown variant until a typed Flue projection is
  justified.
- Edits, deletion, typing, reactions, uploads, MarkdownV2 policy, keyboards,
  media, streaming, guest replies, and broader Bot API operations remain
  project-owned grammY behavior rather than Flue abstractions.
- Telegram does not expose complete bot message history. Flue does not add
  process-local message caching to this stateless ingress package.
- No live bot, BotFather configuration, token, webhook, or provider request
  was used in automated or manual validation.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Telegram adapter README after
  implementation; no reference source, declarations, fixtures, payloads,
  sample messages, or tests were used.
- Verified webhook messages, channel posts, edits, business messages, guest
  messages, callbacks, commands, and reactions are represented. Mentions and
  other entity policy remain application behavior over the verified message
  text and raw Update.
- Posting is demonstrated through the project-owned full grammY client.
  Editing, deletion, reactions, typing, uploads, keyboards, formatting,
  streaming, guest replies, and other broad outbound capabilities remain
  project-owned SDK behavior.
- Polling is deliberately excluded because Telegram makes it mutually
  exclusive with webhook delivery and Flue channels own HTTP ingress.
- Reference-cached history and formatting abstractions are not provider
  ingress capabilities and do not justify Flue-owned state or rendering.
- No justified verified HTTP ingress gap remains.

### WhatsApp Business Cloud — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The pinned high-level adapter documentation describes Meta GET verification
  and signed POST webhooks, direct and group conversations, text and media
  messages, locations, shared contacts, interactive replies, reactions,
  posting, read receipts, typing indicators, rich interactive outbound
  messages, message chunking, and the Cloud API's lack of message-history
  retrieval.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, package declarations,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Meta's current WhatsApp Business Platform webhook overview and create-endpoint
  documentation for TLS, GET challenge validation, exact-body
  `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification, JSON encoding, the 3 MB payload maximum,
  batches of up to 1000 updates, duplicate delivery, and retries for up to
  seven days.
- Meta's current `messages` webhook reference and the dedicated text, audio,
  document, image, video, sticker, location, contacts, interactive, button,
  reaction, status, edit, revoke, group, and unsupported message references.
- Meta's current outbound text-message and Message API documentation.
- Meta's current Graph API changelog, which identifies v25.0 as the current
  Graph version on 2026-06-13.
- Current `facebook-nodejs-business-sdk@24.0.1`,
  `whatsapp@0.0.5-Alpha`, and community client package metadata.
- Current `@kapso/whatsapp-cloud-api@0.2.1` package metadata, declarations,
  README, and published root-client source.

Clean-room affirmation:

- All public types, normalized event families, synthetic webhook bodies, fake
  ids, timestamps, signatures, assertions, and tests were designed from Meta's
  primary documentation and Flue's existing channel contract. Nothing was
  copied or translated from Chat SDK source, architecture, types, fixtures,
  payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/whatsapp` and `flue add whatsapp`.
- Publish GET and POST `/channels/<file>/webhook` routes. GET handles Meta's
  verification challenge internally; POST verifies exact request bytes before
  parsing or application behavior.
- Require an app secret, verify token, fixed WhatsApp Business Account id, and
  fixed business phone-number id. Signed deliveries for another configured
  business identity receive `403`.
- Invoke the application callback once per verified HTTP delivery with an
  ordered `delivery.events` array. Preserve every entry, change, message, and
  status rather than collapsing Meta batches or hiding partial-side-effect
  risks from the application.
- Normalize message, status, and unknown-change events. Message variants cover
  text, media, locations, shared contacts, interactive replies, legacy
  buttons, reactions, revocations, unsupported payloads, and future unknown
  message types.
- Preserve message and status ids plus entry, change, and item positions for
  application-owned duplicate admission. Do not claim replay protection or
  deduplication because Meta supplies no signed delivery timestamp or
  package-level durable store.
- Define separate individual and group conversation identities. Individual
  identity uses the inbound `from` or status `recipient_id` value accepted by
  the send API. Preserve Meta's distinct `wa_id` as sender metadata because
  the official reference warns that it may differ from the phone number.
- Omit authenticated media download URLs from normalized media. Preserve the
  stable asset id, MIME type, hash, caption, filename, and voice flag; the full
  verified provider object remains under `raw` for trusted application code.
- Keep normal Hono and Fetch response behavior: `undefined` becomes an empty
  `200`, JSON-compatible values become response bodies, and `Response` values
  pass through.
- Use the full project-owned `@kapso/whatsapp-cloud-api` root client for
  outbound behavior. Configure Graph v25.0 explicitly. The package is
  Fetch-based, depends only on Zod, accepts an injected Fetch transport, and
  executes in Node and workerd without `nodejs_compat`.

Tests:

- Added original synthetic direct and group messages, text, media, locations,
  shared contacts, interactive list replies, reactions and reaction removal,
  revocations, unsupported types, future message types, outbound statuses,
  unknown change fields, and empty deliveries with distinct fake ids, phone
  numbers, timestamps, names, and ordering.
- Covered valid and changed GET verification tokens, duplicate query
  parameters, exact-body HMAC verification, changed Unicode bytes, missing and
  malformed signatures, wrong content types, malformed JSON and envelopes,
  body limits, fixed business-account and phone-number mismatches, response
  serialization, Hono status control, handler failure, and canonical
  individual and group keys.
- Added permanent workerd execution of GET verification, Web Crypto HMAC
  validation, changed-body rejection, and batch normalization without Node
  compatibility flags.
- Added permanent workerd execution of the real
  `@kapso/whatsapp-cloud-api` `WhatsAppClient`, exercising individual and
  group `messages.sendText()` calls against an injected fake Fetch transport
  without Node compatibility flags.
- Added Node execution of the same real client request path against an
  injected fake Fetch transport.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, eight Node protocol tests, and workerd
  ingress tests pass.
- Example strict typecheck, real client Node and workerd tests, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass. Both builds discover exactly one `whatsapp` channel.
- A built Node server returned the configured GET challenge with `200`, empty
  `200` for an original signed unknown-field delivery, and `401` for the same
  POST with a changed signature.
- Documentation check passes.
- Documentation production build passes and renders both WhatsApp pages.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies the WhatsApp route,
  package, SDK dependency, and signature guidance.
- Scoped Biome lint and whitespace validation pass.
- Prepared publish docs were generated for all public packages.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license metadata, and prepared docs without an outbound client or
  model tool.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer compiles against the packed tarball and
  narrows message, status, and unknown events plus canonical identity.

Focused review:

- Reviewed the complete provider implementation for GET token validation,
  exact-byte HMAC ordering, body limits, fixed WABA and phone identity,
  all-or-nothing callback invocation, batch position preservation, direct and
  group identity, media capability boundaries, response handling, SDK
  request construction, emitted declarations, and documentation.
- Added actual Node execution of the outbound SDK path after review found that
  the initial evidence covered a Node bundle but only workerd runtime
  execution.
- Corrected the API wording so the implementation's exact default is stated as
  `3 * 1024 * 1024` bytes without converting Meta's prose "3 MB" into a more
  precise provider claim.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial brief treated direct Graph API Fetch as the baseline
  Cloudflare path. A maintained community SDK now exposes a full Fetch-based
  root client, accepts an injected transport, has no Node runtime dependency,
  builds in both Flue targets, and executes its real request path under
  workerd. The canonical recipe therefore exports that full client instead of
  maintaining a narrow example-only Fetch wrapper.
- The plan did not prescribe callback cardinality for Meta batches. A single
  callback per verified delivery preserves the complete retry unit and lets
  application code decide how to handle partial side effects. Invoking a
  callback independently for each item would hide the fact that one failure
  retries the entire signed POST.
- The plan left account and phone-number identity constraints open. Both are
  required because one app secret can authenticate webhook traffic for more
  than one Meta business asset; a fixed channel should not silently accept a
  different WABA or phone number.

Deferrals:

- Meta app creation, system-user token provisioning, webhook subscription,
  WABA or phone-number overrides, token rotation, and multi-tenant installation
  state remain application and deployment concerns.
- Account alerts, template lifecycle, business capability, phone-number
  quality, history synchronization, user preferences, and other non-`messages`
  fields remain explicit verified unknown changes until a Flue use case
  justifies a stable projection.
- Edit delivery is currently documented by Meta as temporarily unsupported and
  emitted through the unsupported-message form. Flue does not promise a stable
  edit projection until Meta restores the protocol.
- Flow data-endpoint encryption and other server utilities remain outside the
  channel package. The canonical project path uses the SDK root export and
  does not require its `/server` subpath.
- Read receipts, typing indicators, reactions, media retrieval, templates,
  buttons, lists, Flows, message chunking, and broader Graph API operations
  remain project-owned SDK behavior rather than Flue abstractions.
- No live Meta app, access token, WABA, phone number, webhook, or provider
  request was used in automated or manual validation.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level WhatsApp adapter README after
  implementation; no reference source, declarations, fixtures, payloads,
  sample messages, or tests were used.
- Verified text, image, document, audio, voice, video, sticker, location,
  interactive reply, reaction, direct-message, and group-message ingress are
  represented. Shared contacts and current Meta revoke and unsupported forms
  are also covered.
- Posting, rich buttons and lists, reactions, read state, typing, media,
  templates, and other outbound capabilities remain available through the
  project-owned full SDK.
- Buffered streaming and automatic 4096-character chunking are application
  presentation policies, not verified ingress contracts.
- Meta does not expose historical Cloud API message retrieval, so Flue does
  not add process-local history or claim a history API.
- No justified verified HTTP ingress gap remains.

### Twilio Messaging — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The pinned high-level adapter documentation describes SMS and MMS webhook
  ingress, Messages API posting, private inbound media retrieval, phone-number
  and Messaging Service sending, delivery callbacks, and separate low-level
  Voice helpers.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, package declarations,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Twilio's current request-validation documentation for the exact configured
  URL, evolving form parameters, HMAC-SHA1 signatures, `bodySHA256` JSON
  requests, proxy caveats, and the requirement to validate every webhook.
- Twilio's current Messaging webhook request documentation for required and
  optional SMS, MMS, geographic, rich-message, channel, and Advanced Opt-Out
  fields.
- Twilio's current outbound Message resource and delivery-status callback
  documentation.
- Twilio's current webhook connection-override documentation for retry
  behavior and the `I-Twilio-Idempotency-Token` header.
- Official `twilio@6.0.2` package metadata, declarations, README, and published
  request-validation source.
- Cloudflare's current Twilio Workers tutorial, which uses standards-based
  Fetch and HTTP Basic authentication for the Twilio REST API.

Clean-room affirmation:

- The public API, normalized types, synthetic forms, fake ids, signatures,
  assertions, and tests are being designed from Twilio's primary
  documentation, official helper source, Cloudflare's current platform
  guidance, and Flue's existing channel contract. Nothing is copied or
  translated from Chat SDK source, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads,
  snapshots, sample messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/twilio` and `flue add twilio`, scoped to Programmable Messaging.
  Voice remains outside the package.
- Publish required `POST /channels/<file>/webhook` ingress and an optional
  `POST /channels/<file>/status` callback route.
- Require the exact configured public URL for each enabled route. Twilio signs
  the configured external URL rather than a framework-relative path, and
  reconstructing it from a proxied request is not reliable.
- Verify all form parameters with Web Crypto HMAC-SHA1 before normalization.
  Preserve duplicate parameter semantics compatible with the current official
  Twilio helper and validate the request query against the configured signed
  URL. Flue route matching owns the internal path, which may differ when a
  trusted proxy strips an external prefix.
- Require one fixed account plus either one recipient address or one Messaging
  Service. Reject a validly signed callback for another configured identity.
- Normalize SMS/MMS messages, media metadata, Advanced Opt-Out, geographic and
  rich-message metadata, retry identity, and provider parameters. Normalize
  delivery status as a separate optional surface and preserve future provider
  states explicitly.
- Use canonical conversation identity containing the fixed account, inbound
  recipient address, external participant, and optional Messaging Service.
- Scope Messaging Service status callbacks by the fixed account and exact
  signed callback URL because Twilio's documented status subset does not
  guarantee `MessagingServiceSid`. Reject a mismatched service when Twilio does
  include one, and derive canonical service identity from authored
  configuration rather than optional callback metadata.
- Keep Twilio-native response handling narrow: `undefined` acknowledges an
  inbound message with an empty TwiML `<Response/>`; ordinary Hono or Fetch
  `Response` values pass through for explicit TwiML and status control.
- Do not use the official Node helper in the canonical project path. The
  current package declares Node 20, has no browser or edge export, and depends
  on Node-oriented Axios, proxy-agent, JWT, query-string, and XML libraries.
  The canonical Node and Workers path is a project-owned direct REST Fetch
  client using Twilio's documented Basic authentication and form encoding.

Tests:

- Added original synthetic SMS, MMS, Advanced Opt-Out, location,
  rich-message, unknown status, delivery-error, retry-token, duplicate-field,
  and future-form-field cases with distinct fake ids, addresses, URLs, and
  message content.
- Used the current official Twilio helper only as an independent Node signature
  oracle for original synthetic forms. No provider fixture or sample payload
  was copied.
- Covered exact configured public URLs, query strings, connection fragments,
  reverse-proxy path differences, changed bodies, malformed signatures,
  unsupported content, body limits, malformed fields, fixed account, address,
  and Messaging Service identity, response pass-through, handler failure, and
  canonical conversation-key round trips.
- Added permanent workerd execution of Web Crypto HMAC-SHA1 verification and
  changed-body rejection without Node compatibility flags.
- Added Node and workerd execution of the project-owned Fetch client against
  injected local transports for both phone-number and Messaging Service sends.

Validation:

- Package strict typecheck, seven Node protocol tests, workerd ingress test,
  and production build pass.
- Example strict typecheck, Node and workerd client tests, Node build, and
  Cloudflare build pass. Both builds discover exactly one `twilio` channel.
- The real `flue add` CLI test suite passes and verifies both routes,
  signature guidance, form encoding, package selection, and the
  Workers-compatible client path.
- Scoped Biome validation, Knip, whitespace validation, and a frozen offline
  workspace install pass.
- The packed package contains the intended runtime declarations, JavaScript,
  README, license metadata, and prepared Twilio docs without the project-owned
  outbound client or model tool.
- No automated or manual test contacted Twilio.

Focused review:

- Reviewed configured-URL signature semantics, query handling, duplicate form
  values, fixed account and destination checks, status callback scoping,
  canonical identity, TwiML defaults, response pass-through, Web Crypto
  execution, Fetch request construction, emitted declarations, recipe
  guidance, and documentation.
- Removed a stale unused status-normalization parameter left after canonical
  Messaging Service identity moved to authored configuration.
- No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- The initial design proposed comparing the incoming pathname with the
  configured public URL. That would make the explicit URL option unable to
  support a common reverse-proxy case where the public path carries an outer
  prefix that is removed before Flue receives the request. The implementation
  instead signs the exact configured external URL, compares its query string
  with the request, and relies on Flue's fixed route for internal path
  selection. A signature from another configured Twilio URL does not validate
  against this channel's public URL.

Deferrals:

- Twilio Voice, Conversations, Verify, SendGrid, OAuth installation,
  subaccount routing, credential rotation, and dynamic multi-number or
  multi-service tenancy remain outside this fixed Messaging channel.
- Twilio's generic `bodySHA256` JSON webhook validation is not initially a
  Messaging route because current Programmable Messaging inbound and status
  callback documentation specifies form-encoded requests. Add a JSON surface
  only when a concrete Messaging callback requires it.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Twilio adapter documentation during
  research and final capability comparison; no reference source,
  declarations, fixtures, payloads, sample messages, or tests were used.
- Verified SMS and MMS ingress, private media metadata, phone-number and
  Messaging Service identity, outbound posting, and delivery callbacks are
  represented.
- Authenticated media retrieval and the broader Messages API remain
  project-owned Fetch behavior rather than Flue abstractions.
- Voice is a separate Twilio product surface and does not justify expanding
  the Programmable Messaging channel.
- No justified verified HTTP ingress gap remains.

### Facebook Messenger — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Reference capability brief:

- The pinned high-level adapter documentation describes direct-message
  webhook ingress, text and attachment messages, quick replies, postbacks,
  reactions, delivery and read state, outbound text and rich templates,
  typing indicators, and process-local sent-message history.
- No reference implementation, architecture, types, package declarations,
  fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample messages, or tests were consulted.

Primary sources:

- Meta's current Messenger Platform webhook overview for the Page object,
  five-second acknowledgement deadline, `EVENT_RECEIVED` response, exact
  `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification, Page subscription setup, retries,
  ordering caveats, supported webhook fields, and lack of historical webhook
  retrieval.
- Meta's current generic Webhooks documentation for GET verification,
  batched entry semantics, exact signed event notifications, duplicate
  delivery, and retry behavior.
- Meta's current `messages`, `message_echoes`, `message_edits`,
  `messaging_postbacks`, `message_reactions`, `message_deliveries`,
  `message_reads`, `messaging_optins`, and `messaging_referrals` webhook
  references.
- Meta's current Send API and sender-action documentation for Graph v25.0,
  Page-scoped recipient ids, `user_ref`, messaging types, message-window
  policy, sender actions, reactions, and `/PAGE_ID/messages`.
- Current `facebook-nodejs-business-sdk@24.0.1`,
  `@warriorteam/messenger-sdk@1.5.8`, and other candidate package metadata.
- Cloudflare's current Fetch and Web Crypto documentation for standards-based
  outbound HTTP and HMAC-SHA256 verification.

Clean-room affirmation:

- The public API, normalized event families, synthetic webhook bodies, fake
  ids, timestamps, signatures, assertions, and tests are being designed from
  Meta's primary documentation, Cloudflare's current platform guidance, and
  Flue's existing channel contract. Nothing is copied or translated from Chat
  SDK source, architecture, types, fixtures, payloads, snapshots, sample
  messages, or tests.

Decisions:

- Add `@flue/messenger` and `flue add messenger`, scoped to Facebook Page
  Messenger conversations.
- Publish GET and POST `/channels/<file>/webhook` routes. GET performs Meta's
  verification challenge internally; POST verifies the exact request bytes
  before parsing or application behavior.
- Require an app secret, verify token, and fixed Page id. The app secret
  authenticates the configured Meta app; every entry and every normalized
  event must belong to the fixed Page.
- Invoke the application callback once per verified HTTP delivery with an
  ordered `delivery.events` array. Preserve entry and event positions because
  one failure retries the complete signed POST and Meta may batch updates.
- Normalize inbound messages, message echoes, edits, postbacks, reactions,
  deliveries, reads, opt-ins, referrals, and explicit unknown events. Accept
  the documented `messaging` collection and preserve unsupported `standby`,
  `changes`, and future event forms without inventing Handover behavior.
- Model canonical destinations as either a Page-scoped person id or a
  `user_ref`, always namespaced by the fixed Page. Echo events reverse sender
  and recipient roles but retain the same Page-plus-participant conversation.
- Expose marketing-message notification tokens only under a documented
  trusted `capabilities` object. Raw events and capabilities must remain
  outside dispatch input, model context, logs, and durable session data.
- Default an undefined handler result to Meta's documented
  `EVENT_RECEIVED` text response with status `200`. JSON-compatible values and
  ordinary Hono or Fetch responses remain available for explicit control.
- Enforce a configurable handler deadline no greater than 4500 ms, leaving
  time before Meta's five-second acknowledgement requirement.
- Use a project-owned Graph API Fetch client for outbound behavior. The
  official JavaScript Business SDK is a Marketing API SDK built around Axios,
  and current Messenger-specific community clients do not establish a
  browser or Workers support contract. The example client will expose a
  generic request method plus typed message and sender-action operations so
  applications can extend provider behavior without a Flue-owned outbound
  abstraction.

Tests:

- Added original synthetic verification challenges and signed Page deliveries
  covering batched messages, echoes, edits, postbacks, reactions, delivery and
  read state, opt-ins, referrals, standby events, changes, and future fields.
- Covered exact-body HMAC-SHA256 verification, malformed and changed bodies,
  body limits, fixed Page identity, conversation-key round trips, default and
  explicit responses, handler failure, and handler deadlines.
- Added permanent workerd execution of ingress verification and of the
  project-owned Graph Fetch client against injected local transports.

Validation:

- Package build, strict typecheck, seven Node protocol tests, and workerd
  verification test pass.
- Example strict typecheck, Node and workerd client tests, and Node and
  Cloudflare target builds pass. Both builds discover exactly one `messenger`
  channel.
- The real `flue add` Node test suite passes and verifies the named recipe,
  route, signature guidance, acknowledgement, batched changes, and Graph
  Fetch path.
- Scoped Biome and Prettier validation, Knip, whitespace validation, and a
  frozen offline workspace install pass.
- No automated or manual test contacted Meta.

Focused review:

- Reviewed verification challenge handling, exact request-byte signatures,
  Page identity, event ordering, canonical conversation identity, capability
  isolation, timeout behavior, response serialization, Workers execution,
  Fetch request construction, recipe guidance, and documentation.
- Removed an unnecessary exported example-only JSON helper type found by
  Knip. No unresolved correctness findings remain.

Deviations:

- None. Research confirmed the planned Worker-native Web Crypto ingress and
  project-owned Fetch client path.

Deferrals:

- Meta app creation, Page connection, App Review, access-level approval,
  Page access-token generation and rotation, webhook field subscription, and
  multi-Page installation storage remain application and deployment concerns.
- Instagram Messaging is not silently combined with Facebook Messenger even
  though current Meta documentation shares selected endpoints and webhook
  fields. It has different identity and event behavior and should receive a
  separate explicit product decision.
- Handover Protocol, `standby`, account linking, games, policy enforcement,
  feedback, commerce carts, calling, and group-feed behavior remain explicit
  verified unknown events until a concrete Flue use case justifies stable
  projections.
- Marketing-message policy, tags, one-time notifications, private replies,
  personas, rich templates, attachments, reactions, typing, read state, and
  broader Graph operations remain project-owned client behavior.
- Messenger does not expose historical webhook notifications. Flue will not
  add process-local message caches or claim provider-backed history.

Final reference gap audit:

- Reopened only the pinned high-level Messenger adapter documentation during
  research and final capability comparison; no reference source,
  declarations, fixtures, payloads, sample messages, or tests were used.
- Verified direct-message ingress, text and attachment metadata, quick
  replies, postbacks, reactions, delivery and read state, outbound posting,
  and typing/sender actions are represented between the channel and editable
  project client.
- Rich templates, attachment upload, marketing policy, account linking, and
  broader Graph behavior remain project-owned client concerns.
- No justified verified HTTP ingress gap remains.

## Implementation log template

Append one section per provider while implementing:

```md
### <Provider> — YYYY-MM-DD

Status:

- Research / design / implementation / docs / audit / complete

Reference capability brief:

- High-level capabilities observed without consulting implementation or tests

Primary sources:

- Official protocol docs
- Official security docs
- Official SDK docs/source

Clean-room affirmation:

- No source, types, fixtures, payloads, snapshots, or tests copied or translated

Decisions:

- Package and recipe name
- Routes and optional surfaces
- Constructor inputs
- Event and identity model
- Response behavior
- Outbound SDK/client recommendation
- Node and Cloudflare support

Tests:

- Synthetic fixture origin and how it differs from official examples
- Node coverage
- workerd coverage
- example fake-transport coverage
- signed built-example smoke result

Deviations:

- Evidence, alternatives, choice, and impact

Deferrals:

- Consequential unresolved question and why unrelated work can continue

Final reference gap audit:

- Applicable gaps resolved from primary sources
- Deliberate non-goals and remaining differences
```

## Validation

Run focused validation during each provider workstream, then the complete
repository gates in dependency order.

Per package, adapt:

```sh
pnpm --filter @flue/<provider> run build
pnpm --filter @flue/<provider> run check:types
pnpm --filter @flue/<provider> run test
pnpm --filter @flue/<provider> run test:workerd
```

Per example, adapt:

```sh
pnpm --filter <provider>-channel-example run check:types
pnpm --filter <provider>-channel-example run build
pnpm --filter <provider>-channel-example run test:workerd
```

Shared gates:

```sh
pnpm --dir packages/runtime run build
pnpm --dir packages/runtime run check:types
pnpm --dir packages/runtime run test

pnpm --dir packages/cli run build
pnpm --dir packages/cli run check:types
pnpm --dir packages/cli run test

pnpm --dir apps/docs run check
pnpm --dir apps/docs run build

pnpm run check
git diff --check
```

Also:

- run `scripts/prepare-publish.mjs`;
- pack every channel package and inspect its contents;
- compile clean strict consumers from packed artifacts;
- exercise every named recipe through the real `flue add` output path;
- send synthetic valid and invalid requests to every built example without
  contacting a provider;
- execute one representative outbound request-construction and authentication
  path for every example in workerd against a fake Fetch endpoint;
- run scoped stale-claim and secret/capability searches;
- perform one focused review of the completed cross-provider work and
  independently evaluate each concrete finding.

## Completion criteria

This plan is complete when:

- all ten external providers have an intentional Flue channel outcome;
- the seven net-new packages are implemented unless primary-source research
  produces a recorded consequential blocker;
- GitHub, Slack, and Discord are audited and expanded where applicable;
- every supported HTTP surface verifies requests before application behavior;
- provider identity, batching, retries, handshakes, and mandatory responses are
  represented correctly;
- every package follows the established discovered-channel and Hono handler
  contract without unnecessary cross-provider abstraction;
- project-owned outbound clients and application-owned tools remain the only
  outbound model;
- named `flue add` recipes, examples, guides, API references, navigation, and
  changelog entries exist for every supported provider;
- all fixtures and tests are original, synthetic, offline, and derived from
  primary provider specifications rather than the reference repository;
- Node and Cloudflare behavior are exercised for every completed provider;
- Cloudflare is supported for every completed provider; no canonical recipe
  depends on a Node-only client;
- official SDKs that fail the workerd execution gate are replaced by proven
  cross-runtime clients or narrow standards-based Fetch implementations;
- package tarballs and clean consumers contain only the intended public
  contract;
- the final pinned-reference gap audit is recorded for every provider;
- deviations and unresolved consequential decisions are explicit;
- repository-wide validation and focused review pass;
- no live provider API or credential is required for automated validation.

## Final cross-provider audit — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete

Implemented outcomes:

- GitHub, Slack, and Discord received focused audits and intentional ingress
  expansion.
- Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Linear, Telegram, WhatsApp Business Cloud,
  Twilio Messaging, and Facebook Messenger were added as first-party channel
  packages.
- Every provider has a named `flue add` recipe, buildable project example,
  setup guide, API reference, Node protocol coverage, workerd coverage, and a
  recorded clean-room reference audit.
- Every canonical outbound project path executes in workerd. Node-oriented
  provider SDKs were replaced with standards-based Fetch clients where needed.

Fresh final validation:

- `pnpm run check` passed across the 37-project workspace. All 55 test tasks
  passed. Biome reported only existing advisory warnings outside this channel
  work.
- Forced package build, strict typecheck, Node protocol tests, and workerd
  tests passed for all ten channel packages.
- Forced example strict typecheck, Node build, local client tests, and
  Cloudflare target builds passed for all ten examples.
- `apps/docs` check and production build passed and rendered all channel guide
  and API pages.
- `apps/www` production build rendered all ten named connector routes.
- `scripts/prepare-publish.mjs` completed successfully.
- All ten channel packages packed successfully. Each tarball contained only
  `dist`, generated docs, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `package.json`.
- A clean strict TypeScript consumer installed all ten tarballs offline,
  typechecked their public constructors and option types, and imported every
  constructor at runtime.
- The real built CLI printed all ten named recipes through a local registry
  transport. The focused `flue add` suite passed 11 tests.
- Frozen offline workspace installation, Knip, Biome, Prettier, whitespace
  validation, stale-claim searches, and credential-pattern searches passed.
  Credential scanning found only a documented private-key placeholder and the
  generated synthetic Google test key.
- No validation contacted a provider API.

Focused review:

- Reviewed discovery and mounting parity with agents, custom `flue()` prefixes,
  route validation and method handling, optional surface publication, package
  exports, response serialization, exact-body verification, identity checks,
  body limits, deadlines, canonical conversation keys, capability isolation,
  Cloudflare dependencies, recipes, docs, examples, and packed artifacts.
- Corrected the main Channels guide after review found that Slack's implemented
  optional `/commands` route was missing from the shared route table,
  file-routing example, and optional-surface description.
- Corrected Turbo cache inputs so `apps/www` connector output is invalidated
  whenever top-level `connectors/**` changes.
- No unresolved correctness or durability findings remain within this plan's
  scope.

Validation notes:

- One parallel audit command allowed an example typecheck to race a package
  build while that build replaced `dist`. The transient module-resolution
  failure disappeared when the intended dependency order was restored; the
  complete serial example pass succeeded.
- Calling the unreleased CLI against the currently deployed public registry
  correctly cannot retrieve branch-only recipes. The local-registry path and
  website build pass. Deploying the updated registry site is a release
  prerequisite, not an implementation defect.
- Cloudflare builds continue to emit the repository's existing example warning
  about missing Durable Object migrations. That deployment concern is broader
  than channels and is recorded in the follow-up roadmap.

Material deviations:

- None from the final provider plan. Provider-level implementation deviations
  and their primary-source reasoning remain recorded in each provider log.
- The final audit added the `apps-www` Turbo input fix because connector
  recipes are read from outside the app package and otherwise could be served
  from a stale build cache.

Remaining deferrals:

- Package publication, versioning, registry-site deployment, and live
  credential smoke tests require an explicit release operation.
- Provider installation, OAuth, token rotation, multi-tenant credential
  storage, webhook registration, and broad outbound API behavior remain
  application or deployment concerns.
- Long-lived transports such as Discord Gateway, Slack Socket Mode, and
  Telegram polling remain outside first-party HTTP channels.
- The prioritized continuation roadmap is
  `plans/2026-06-13-channel-followups-roadmap.md`.

## Slack simplification follow-up — 2026-06-13

Status:

- Complete.

Implemented:

- Removed `appId` and `teamId` from `SlackChannelOptions`. Slack's signing
  secret authenticates the app; workspace and enterprise authorization now
  remain application policy over the provider-native payload.
- Removed fixed-workspace and org-install rejection. Authenticated deliveries
  from multiple workspaces and Enterprise Grid installations reach the
  configured handler unchanged.
- Removed `handlerTimeoutMs` and the package-owned timeout/error wrapper.
  Callbacks are awaited normally, and thrown errors flow through Hono's
  standard error handling.
- Removed local types for legacy interactive messages, legacy dialogs, and
  deprecated workflow-step editing. Runtime forwarding remains
  forward-compatible; the public union covers current documented HTTP
  interaction families.
- Removed the redundant `SlackViewValidationResponse` type and recursive
  package-owned JSON validator. Handler results now use the channel contract
  directly: `undefined` becomes an empty `200`, responses pass through, and
  other typed values use `Response.json()`.
- Kept `teamId` in `SlackThreadRef` because canonical multi-workspace
  conversation identity still requires it.
- Updated the package README, editable example, connector recipe, API
  reference, ecosystem guide, CLI recipe assertions, and changelog.

Impact:

- The Slack package source and active Node test suite dropped by 435 net lines.
- The channel now has two ingress credentials instead of four in the editable
  example: `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` for inbound verification and
  `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` for project-owned outbound API calls.
- Slow callbacks are no longer followed by uncancelled package work after an
  artificial timeout response. Applications remain responsible for admitting
  durable work promptly within Slack's acknowledgement expectations.

Validation:

- `@flue/slack` strict typecheck, build, 18 Node tests, and 2 workerd tests
  pass.
- The Slack example strict typecheck, 3 real-client workerd tests, Node build,
  and Cloudflare build pass. Cloudflare reports only the existing Durable
  Object migration warning.
- The complete 18-test `flue add` suite passes and asserts that the Slack
  recipe no longer emits `SLACK_APP_ID` or `SLACK_TEAM_ID`.
- Documentation check and production build pass alongside the concurrent docs
  work.
- `scripts/prepare-publish.mjs` passes. The packed package exposes the reduced
  declarations, and a clean offline strict consumer installs the tarball,
  typechecks a custom Hono environment, and imports the constructor at runtime.
- The built Node example starts with only `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` and
  `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`; a locally signed URL-verification request returns the
  documented `200` challenge response.
- Scoped Biome, Prettier, and whitespace checks pass.
